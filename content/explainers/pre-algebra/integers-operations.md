# Operations with Integers

## What are Integers?

Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They include no fractions or decimals.

**Set of integers:** {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

Examples:
- Positive integers: 1, 2, 3, 50, 1000
- Negative integers: -1, -2, -3, -50, -1000
- Zero: 0 (neither positive nor negative)

## Rules for Integer Operations

### Adding Integers

**Same signs:** Add and keep the sign
- 5 + 3 = 8 (both positive)
- -5 + (-3) = -8 (both negative)

**Different signs:** Subtract smaller from larger, use sign of larger
- 5 + (-3) = 2 (5 is larger, positive)
- -5 + 3 = -2 (5 is larger, negative)

### Subtracting Integers

**Key rule:** Subtracting is the same as adding the opposite
- a - b = a + (-b)

Examples:
- 7 - 3 = 7 + (-3) = 4
- 7 - (-3) = 7 + 3 = 10
- -7 - 3 = -7 + (-3) = -10

### Multiplying Integers

**Same signs:** Product is positive
- 3 × 4 = 12 (positive × positive)
- (-3) × (-4) = 12 (negative × negative)

**Different signs:** Product is negative
- 3 × (-4) = -12 (positive × negative)
- (-3) × 4 = -12 (negative × positive)

### Dividing Integers

**Same signs:** Quotient is positive
- 12 ÷ 4 = 3
- (-12) ÷ (-4) = 3

**Different signs:** Quotient is negative
- 12 ÷ (-4) = -3
- (-12) ÷ 4 = -3

## Step-by-Step Examples

### Example 1: Adding with different signs
**Calculate:** -8 + 5

```
Step 1: Different signs, so subtract
|8| - |5| = 8 - 5 = 3

Step 2: Use sign of number with larger absolute value
8 > 5, and 8 is negative

Answer: -3
```

**Check:** Think of it as owing $8 and receiving $5 → still owe $3 ✓

### Example 2: Subtracting a negative
**Calculate:** 4 - (-6)

```
Step 1: Change subtraction to adding opposite
4 - (-6) = 4 + 6

Step 2: Add
4 + 6 = 10
```

**Check:** Removing a debt is like gaining ✓

### Example 3: Multiplying negatives
**Calculate:** (-5) × (-3)

```
Same signs → positive result
5 × 3 = 15

Answer: 15
```

**Check:** Negative × negative = positive ✓

### Example 4: Division with different signs
**Calculate:** -24 ÷ 6

```
Different signs → negative result
24 ÷ 6 = 4

Answer: -4
```

**Check:** (-4) × 6 = -24 ✓

## More Complex Examples

### Example 5: Multiple operations
**Calculate:** -3 + 8 - 5

```
Work left to right:
-3 + 8 = 5
5 - 5 = 0

Answer: 0
```

### Example 6: Multiplication and division
**Calculate:** (-2) × 6 ÷ (-3)

```
Work left to right:
(-2) × 6 = -12
-12 ÷ (-3) = 4

Answer: 4
```

### Example 7: Order of operations with integers
**Calculate:** -5 + 3 × (-2)

```
Step 1: Multiply first (PEMDAS)
3 × (-2) = -6

Step 2: Add
-5 + (-6) = -11

Answer: -11
```

**Check:** Following PEMDAS is crucial ✓

## Sign Rules Summary

**Addition:**
- (+) + (+) = (+): 5 + 3 = 8
- (-) + (-) = (-): -5 + (-3) = -8
- (+) + (-) = sign of larger: 5 + (-3) = 2
- (-) + (+) = sign of larger: -5 + 3 = -2

**Subtraction:**
- Change to adding opposite: a - b = a + (-b)

**Multiplication/Division:**
- Same signs = (+): 6 × 2 = 12 or (-6) × (-2) = 12
- Different signs = (-): 6 × (-2) = -12 or (-6) × 2 = -12

## Number Line Visualization

Think of a number line:
```
<---(-5)--(-4)--(-3)--(-2)--(-1)--(0)--(1)--(2)--(3)--(4)--(5)--->
```

**Adding positive:** Move right
**Adding negative:** Move left
**Subtracting positive:** Move left
**Subtracting negative:** Move right

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Two negatives make a positive** - Only for multiplication/division
✓ **Subtracting = adding opposite** - a - b = a + (-b)
✓ **Different signs in multiply/divide** - Result is negative
✓ **Same signs in multiply/divide** - Result is positive
✓ **Use number line** - Visualize operations
✓ **Absolute value helps** - For addition with different signs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Double negative confusion** - Wrong: -3 - (-2) = -5
✓ Correct: -3 - (-2) = -3 + 2 = -1

❌ **Sign errors in multiplication** - Wrong: (-3) × (-2) = -6
✓ Correct: (-3) × (-2) = 6 (same signs = positive)

❌ **Adding instead of subtracting absolute values** - Wrong: -5 + 3 = -8
✓ Correct: -5 + 3 = -2 (subtract: 5 - 3 = 2, keep larger sign)

❌ **Forgetting order of operations** - Wrong: -2 + 3 × 4 = 4
✓ Correct: -2 + 3 × 4 = -2 + 12 = 10
