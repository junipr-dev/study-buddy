# Ratios and Proportions

## What is a Ratio?

A ratio compares two quantities by division. It shows how many times one value contains or is contained within the other.

**Ways to write ratios:**
- Using colon: 3:4 (read as "3 to 4")
- As fraction: 3/4
- Using "to": 3 to 4

Examples:
- Ratio of boys to girls: 15:12 or 5:4 (simplified)
- Recipe ratio: 2 cups flour to 1 cup sugar = 2:1
- Speed: 60 miles in 1 hour = 60:1

## What is a Proportion?

A proportion is an equation that states two ratios are equal.

**General form:** a/b = c/d or a:b = c:d

This means "a is to b as c is to d"

Examples:
- 1/2 = 3/6 (proportion is true)
- 2/3 = 4/6 (proportion is true)
- 3/4 ≠ 2/3 (not a proportion)

## Simplifying Ratios

Like fractions, ratios should be in lowest terms.

### Step-by-Step Example

**Simplify:** 12:18

```
Step 1: Find GCF of 12 and 18
GCF = 6

Step 2: Divide both by 6
12 ÷ 6 = 2
18 ÷ 6 = 3

Simplified ratio: 2:3
```

**Check:** 2 × 6 = 12 and 3 × 6 = 18 ✓

## Solving Proportions

Use **cross-multiplication** to solve proportions:

If a/b = c/d, then a × d = b × c

### Step-by-Step Example

**Solve:** 3/4 = x/12

### Step 1: Set up the proportion
```
3/4 = x/12
```

### Step 2: Cross-multiply
```
3 × 12 = 4 × x
36 = 4x
```

### Step 3: Divide to isolate x
```
36 ÷ 4 = x
9 = x
```

### Step 4: Check your answer
```
3/4 = 9/12
Simplify 9/12: 9/12 = 3/4 ✓
```

## Types of Ratio Problems

### Part-to-Part Ratios
**Compare two parts of a whole**

**Example:** In a class of 30 students, ratio of boys to girls is 3:2

```
Total parts = 3 + 2 = 5
Each part = 30 ÷ 5 = 6

Boys = 3 × 6 = 18
Girls = 2 × 6 = 12
```

**Check:** 18 + 12 = 30 ✓ and 18:12 = 3:2 ✓

### Part-to-Whole Ratios
**Compare one part to the total**

**Example:** 3 out of 5 students wear glasses

```
Ratio with glasses: 3/5
Ratio without: 2/5
```

## More Examples

### Example 1: Recipe proportions
**Recipe calls for 2 cups flour for 3 cups sugar. How much flour for 9 cups sugar?**

```
Set up proportion:
2/3 = x/9

Cross-multiply:
2 × 9 = 3 × x
18 = 3x
x = 6

Need 6 cups of flour
```

**Check:** 2/3 = 6/9, simplify 6/9 = 2/3 ✓

### Example 2: Scale drawing
**Map scale is 1 inch : 50 miles. Cities are 3.5 inches apart on map. Actual distance?**

```
Proportion:
1/50 = 3.5/x

Cross-multiply:
1 × x = 50 × 3.5
x = 175

Actual distance: 175 miles
```

**Check:** 175 ÷ 50 = 3.5 inches ✓

### Example 3: Unit rates
**Car travels 240 miles in 4 hours. How far in 7 hours?**

```
Set up proportion:
240/4 = x/7

Cross-multiply:
240 × 7 = 4 × x
1680 = 4x
x = 420

Distance: 420 miles
```

**Check:** 420 ÷ 7 = 60 mph, 240 ÷ 4 = 60 mph ✓

### Example 4: Similar triangles
**Two triangles are similar. One has sides 3, 4, 5. Other has shortest side 6. Find other sides.**

```
Ratio: 6/3 = 2 (scale factor)

Other sides:
4 × 2 = 8
5 × 2 = 10

Sides: 6, 8, 10
```

**Check:** 6/3 = 8/4 = 10/5 = 2 ✓

## Unit Rates

A unit rate is a ratio with denominator of 1.

**Examples:**
- 60 miles per 1 hour = 60 mph
- $3 per 1 pound = $3/lb
- 25 miles per 1 gallon = 25 mpg

### Finding Unit Rate

**Example:** $6 for 3 pounds of apples

```
Rate = $6/3 pounds
     = $2/1 pound
     = $2 per pound
```

## Equivalent Ratios

Ratios are equivalent if they simplify to the same ratio.

**Example:** Which are equivalent to 2:3?
```
4:6 → 2:3 ✓
6:9 → 2:3 ✓
8:10 → 4:5 ✗
10:15 → 2:3 ✓
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Ratios compare quantities** - Order matters: 3:4 ≠ 4:3
✓ **Simplify ratios** - Like fractions, reduce to lowest terms
✓ **Cross-multiply for proportions** - a/b = c/d → ad = bc
✓ **Unit rates** - Useful for comparing (price per pound, miles per gallon)
✓ **Keep units consistent** - Can't compare feet to inches without converting
✓ **Proportions = equal ratios** - Both sides must be equivalent

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong order** - Wrong: If ratio is boys:girls = 3:2, then 2/3 are boys
✓ Correct: 3/5 are boys (3 out of 3+2=5 total)

❌ **Not simplifying** - Wrong: Leaving ratio as 12:18
✓ Correct: Simplify to 2:3

❌ **Cross-multiplying incorrectly** - Wrong: 2/3 = 4/x → 2x = 12
✓ Correct: 2/3 = 4/x → 2x = 12, but it's 3 × 4 = 2 × x

❌ **Mixing up part-to-part and part-to-whole** - Be clear what's being compared
✓ Correct: Read problem carefully to identify type
