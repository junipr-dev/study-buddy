# Adding Fractions

## What are Fractions?

A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two parts:
- **Numerator** (top number) - how many parts you have
- **Denominator** (bottom number) - how many parts make a whole

Example: 3/4 means 3 parts out of 4 total parts

## Adding Fractions: Two Cases

### Case 1: Same Denominator (Easy!)

When fractions have the same denominator, just add the numerators:

**Rule:** a/d + b/d = (a + b)/d

**Example:** 2/5 + 1/5 = ?

```
2/5 + 1/5 = (2 + 1)/5 = 3/5
```

### Case 2: Different Denominators (Need Common Denominator)

When fractions have different denominators, you must find a common denominator first.

**Steps:**
1. Find the Least Common Denominator (LCD)
2. Convert each fraction to equivalent fraction with LCD
3. Add the numerators
4. Simplify if possible

## Step-by-Step Example

**Add:** 1/3 + 1/4

### Step 1: Find LCD
Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, **12**, 15...
Multiples of 4: 4, 8, **12**, 16...

LCD = 12

### Step 2: Convert fractions
Convert 1/3 to denominator 12:
```
1/3 = ?/12
3 × 4 = 12, so multiply numerator by 4
1 × 4 = 4
1/3 = 4/12
```

Convert 1/4 to denominator 12:
```
1/4 = ?/12
4 × 3 = 12, so multiply numerator by 3
1 × 3 = 3
1/4 = 3/12
```

### Step 3: Add numerators
```
4/12 + 3/12 = (4 + 3)/12 = 7/12
```

### Step 4: Simplify (if needed)
7/12 is already in simplest form (7 and 12 share no common factors)

**Answer:** 7/12

## More Examples

### Example 2: Same denominator
**Add:** 3/8 + 5/8

```
3/8 + 5/8 = (3 + 5)/8 = 8/8 = 1
```

### Example 3: Small denominators
**Add:** 1/2 + 1/3

```
LCD = 6

1/2 = 3/6  (multiply by 3)
1/3 = 2/6  (multiply by 2)

3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6
```

### Example 4: Need to simplify
**Add:** 2/6 + 1/6

```
2/6 + 1/6 = 3/6

Simplify: 3/6 = 1/2 (divide both by 3)
```

## Finding LCD: Quick Methods

### Method 1: List multiples
- List multiples of each denominator
- Find the smallest common one

### Method 2: Multiply denominators
- Quick but not always the smallest
- Example: 2 and 3 → LCD is 2 × 3 = 6

### Method 3: Use GCF
- LCD = (a × b) ÷ GCF(a, b)
- Example: 4 and 6 → GCF is 2 → LCD = 24 ÷ 2 = 12

## Subtracting Fractions

Same rules apply!

**Same denominator:**
```
5/8 - 2/8 = (5 - 2)/8 = 3/8
```

**Different denominators:**
```
3/4 - 1/3

LCD = 12
3/4 = 9/12
1/3 = 4/12

9/12 - 4/12 = 5/12
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Same denominator** - Just add/subtract numerators
✓ **Different denominators** - Must find LCD first
✓ **Don't add denominators** - Only add numerators!
✓ **Always simplify** - Reduce to lowest terms
✓ **Check your LCD** - Should be the smallest common multiple
✓ **Keep denominator** - It doesn't change when adding numerators

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Adding denominators** - Wrong: 1/2 + 1/3 ≠ 2/5
✓ Correct: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6

❌ **Not simplifying** - Always reduce your answer
❌ **Wrong LCD** - Use the smallest common multiple
❌ **Forgetting to convert both** - Must convert all fractions to LCD
