# Absolute Value

## What is Absolute Value?

Absolute value is the distance a number is from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. It's always positive or zero, never negative.

**Notation:** |a| where a is any number

**Definition:** The absolute value of a number is its magnitude without its sign.

Examples:
- |5| = 5 (5 is 5 units from zero)
- |-5| = 5 (-5 is also 5 units from zero)
- |0| = 0 (0 is 0 units from zero)

## Understanding Absolute Value

Think of absolute value as:
- Distance from zero (always positive)
- "How far" not "which direction"
- Removing the negative sign (if there is one)

**Number line visualization:**
```
|-5| = 5        |5| = 5
<----5 units----0----5 units---->
       -5       0        5
```

Both -5 and 5 are 5 units from zero!

## Rules for Absolute Value

**For any number a:**
```
|a| = a   if a ≥ 0  (number is positive or zero)
|a| = -a  if a < 0  (number is negative)
```

Examples:
- |7| = 7 (already positive)
- |-7| = -(-7) = 7 (flip the sign)
- |0| = 0 (stays zero)

## How to Evaluate Absolute Value Expressions

Follow these steps:

1. **Simplify inside** - Do any operations inside |...|
2. **Take absolute value** - Make result positive
3. **Continue operations** - Do any operations outside |...|
4. **Check** - Verify your answer makes sense

## Step-by-Step Examples

### Example 1: Simple absolute value
**Evaluate:** |-12|

```
Step 1: Number inside is -12
Step 2: Distance from zero is 12
Answer: 12
```

**Check:** -12 is 12 units from zero ✓

### Example 2: Absolute value of positive
**Evaluate:** |8|

```
Step 1: Number inside is 8
Step 2: Already positive
Answer: 8
```

**Check:** 8 is 8 units from zero ✓

### Example 3: Expression inside absolute value
**Evaluate:** |3 - 7|

```
Step 1: Simplify inside
3 - 7 = -4

Step 2: Take absolute value
|-4| = 4

Answer: 4
```

**Check:** Distance from 0 to -4 is 4 ✓

### Example 4: Operations with absolute values
**Evaluate:** |-5| + |3|

```
Step 1: Evaluate each absolute value
|-5| = 5
|3| = 3

Step 2: Add
5 + 3 = 8

Answer: 8
```

**Check:** 5 + 3 = 8 ✓

## More Complex Examples

### Example 5: Subtraction with absolute values
**Evaluate:** |8| - |-3|

```
Step 1: Evaluate each
|8| = 8
|-3| = 3

Step 2: Subtract
8 - 3 = 5

Answer: 5
```

### Example 6: Absolute value of product
**Evaluate:** |(-2) × 4|

```
Step 1: Multiply inside
(-2) × 4 = -8

Step 2: Take absolute value
|-8| = 8

Answer: 8
```

### Example 7: Negative outside absolute value
**Evaluate:** -|7|

```
Step 1: Take absolute value
|7| = 7

Step 2: Apply negative outside
-(7) = -7

Answer: -7
```

**Note:** This is DIFFERENT from |-7| = 7

### Example 8: Multiple operations
**Evaluate:** |2 - 5| × |-3|

```
Step 1: Simplify inside each
2 - 5 = -3, so |2 - 5| = |-3| = 3
|-3| = 3

Step 2: Multiply
3 × 3 = 9

Answer: 9
```

## Absolute Value Equations

Sometimes you need to solve for x:

**Example:** |x| = 5

```
This means x is 5 units from zero
Two solutions:
x = 5  or  x = -5
```

**Example:** |x - 3| = 7

```
x - 3 = 7  or  x - 3 = -7
x = 10  or  x = -4
```

**Check:**
```
|10 - 3| = |7| = 7 ✓
|-4 - 3| = |-7| = 7 ✓
```

## Absolute Value Inequalities

**Example:** |x| < 3

```
Means: x is less than 3 units from zero
Solution: -3 < x < 3
```

**Example:** |x| > 2

```
Means: x is more than 2 units from zero
Solution: x < -2  or  x > 2
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Always non-negative** - |a| ≥ 0 for all numbers
✓ **Distance from zero** - Think geometrically on number line
✓ **Removes sign** - |-a| = |a|
✓ **Order matters** - -|a| ≠ |-a| when a is negative
✓ **Two solutions for equations** - |x| = a means x = a or x = -a
✓ **Simplify inside first** - Evaluate what's inside before taking absolute value

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Confusing with negation** - Wrong: |-5| = -5
✓ Correct: |-5| = 5

❌ **Negative outside vs inside** - Wrong: -|5| = 5
✓ Correct: -|5| = -5, but |-5| = 5

❌ **Only one solution** - Wrong: |x| = 3 → x = 3
✓ Correct: |x| = 3 → x = 3 or x = -3

❌ **Absolute value of sum** - Wrong: |a + b| = |a| + |b|
✓ Correct: Not always true! |-5 + 3| = |-2| = 2, but |-5| + |3| = 8
