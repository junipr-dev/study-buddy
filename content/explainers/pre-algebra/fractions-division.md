# Dividing Fractions

## What is Fraction Division?

Dividing fractions uses a simple trick: multiply by the reciprocal. The reciprocal of a fraction is what you get when you flip it upside down.

**Rule:** (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c)

In other words:
- Keep the first fraction
- Change ÷ to ×
- Flip the second fraction

This is often called "Keep, Change, Flip" or "Multiply by the reciprocal"

Examples:
- (1/2) ÷ (1/3) = (1/2) × (3/1) = 3/2
- (2/3) ÷ (4/5) = (2/3) × (5/4) = 10/12 = 5/6
- 6 ÷ (1/2) = 6 × 2 = 12

## Understanding Reciprocals

**Reciprocal:** Flip the fraction (swap numerator and denominator)

Examples:
- Reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3
- Reciprocal of 2/5 is 5/2
- Reciprocal of 5 (= 5/1) is 1/5
- Reciprocal of 1/8 is 8/1 = 8

**Key fact:** A number times its reciprocal equals 1
- (2/3) × (3/2) = 6/6 = 1 ✓

## How to Divide Fractions

Follow these steps:

1. **Keep first fraction** - Don't change it
2. **Change ÷ to ×** - Division becomes multiplication
3. **Flip second fraction** - Write its reciprocal
4. **Multiply** - Now it's a multiplication problem
5. **Simplify** - Reduce to lowest terms
6. **Check** - Verify answer makes sense

## Step-by-Step Example

**Divide:** (2/3) ÷ (4/5)

### Step 1: Keep the first fraction
```
2/3
```

### Step 2: Change division to multiplication
```
2/3 ×
```

### Step 3: Flip the second fraction
```
4/5 becomes 5/4
```

### Step 4: Multiply
```
(2/3) × (5/4) = (2 × 5)/(3 × 4) = 10/12
```

### Step 5: Simplify
```
10/12 = 5/6  (divide both by 2)
```

### Step 6: Check your answer
```
2/3 ≈ 0.67 and 4/5 = 0.80
0.67 ÷ 0.80 ≈ 0.83
5/6 ≈ 0.83 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 1: Simple division
**Divide:** (1/2) ÷ (1/4)

```
Keep, Change, Flip:
(1/2) × (4/1) = 4/2 = 2

Answer: 2
```

**Check:** "How many quarters fit in a half?" → 2 quarters ✓

### Example 2: Dividing by whole number
**Divide:** (3/4) ÷ 2

```
Step 1: Write 2 as fraction
2 = 2/1

Step 2: Keep, Change, Flip
(3/4) × (1/2)

Step 3: Multiply
(3 × 1)/(4 × 2) = 3/8
```

**Check:** Half of 3/4 is 3/8 ✓

### Example 3: Whole number divided by fraction
**Divide:** 6 ÷ (1/3)

```
Step 1: Write 6 as fraction
6 = 6/1

Step 2: Keep, Change, Flip
(6/1) × (3/1)

Step 3: Multiply
6 × 3 = 18
```

**Check:** "How many thirds in 6?" → 18 thirds ✓

### Example 4: With canceling
**Divide:** (5/6) ÷ (10/9)

```
Keep, Change, Flip:
(5/6) × (9/10)

Cancel before multiplying:
5 and 10 share 5:  5/10 = 1/2
6 and 9 share 3:   6/9 = 2/3

(1/2) × (3/2) = 3/4

Answer: 3/4
```

**Check without canceling:**
```
(5 × 9)/(6 × 10) = 45/60 = 3/4 ✓
```

### Example 5: Mixed numbers
**Divide:** 2½ ÷ 1¼

```
Step 1: Convert to improper fractions
2½ = 5/2
1¼ = 5/4

Step 2: Keep, Change, Flip
(5/2) × (4/5)

Step 3: Cancel (5s cancel!)
(1/2) × (4/1) = 4/2 = 2

Answer: 2
```

**Check:** 2.5 ÷ 1.25 = 2 ✓

## Why Does "Flip and Multiply" Work?

**Example:** (1/2) ÷ (1/3)

Think: "How many 1/3s fit into 1/2?"

```
To find out, we ask: (1/2) ÷ (1/3) = ?

Multiply both by 3:
(1/2) × 3 ÷ (1/3) × 3 = 3/2 ÷ 1 = 3/2

So dividing by 1/3 is the same as multiplying by 3!
```

## Word Problem Example

**Problem:** A ribbon is 3/4 yard long. How many pieces of 1/8 yard can you cut from it?

```
3/4 ÷ 1/8

Keep, Change, Flip:
(3/4) × (8/1) = 24/4 = 6

Answer: 6 pieces
```

**Check:** 6 × (1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Keep, Change, Flip** - Easy way to remember the rule
✓ **Division by fraction = Multiply by reciprocal** - They're the same
✓ **Flip only the second fraction** - Never flip the first one
✓ **Whole numbers are n/1** - Makes reciprocal 1/n
✓ **Reciprocals flip numerator and denominator** - a/b becomes b/a
✓ **Always simplify** - Reduce final answer

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Flipping the wrong fraction** - Wrong: (2/3) ÷ (1/4) = (3/2) × (1/4)
✓ Correct: (2/3) ÷ (1/4) = (2/3) × (4/1)

❌ **Flipping both fractions** - Wrong: (1/2) ÷ (1/3) = (2/1) × (3/1)
✓ Correct: (1/2) ÷ (1/3) = (1/2) × (3/1)

❌ **Forgetting to change to ×** - Wrong: (2/3) ÷ (3/2)
✓ Correct: (2/3) × (2/3) after flipping

❌ **Not converting mixed numbers** - Wrong: 2½ ÷ ½ = 1¼
✓ Correct: 5/2 ÷ 1/2 = 5/2 × 2 = 5
