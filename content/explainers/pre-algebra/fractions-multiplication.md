# Multiplying Fractions

## What is Fraction Multiplication?

Multiplying fractions is actually easier than adding them! You don't need to find a common denominator. Simply multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.

**Rule:** (a/b) × (c/d) = (a × c)/(b × d)

Think of it as "multiply across":
- Top × Top = New Top
- Bottom × Bottom = New Bottom

Examples:
- (1/2) × (1/3) = 1/6
- (2/5) × (3/4) = 6/20 = 3/10
- (1/4) × 4 = 4/4 = 1

## How to Multiply Fractions

Follow these steps:

1. **Convert whole numbers** - Write as fractions (a = a/1)
2. **Multiply numerators** - Top × Top
3. **Multiply denominators** - Bottom × Bottom
4. **Simplify** - Reduce to lowest terms
5. **Check** - Verify answer is reasonable

## Step-by-Step Example

**Multiply:** (2/3) × (3/4)

### Step 1: Multiply numerators
```
2 × 3 = 6
```

### Step 2: Multiply denominators
```
3 × 4 = 12
```

### Step 3: Write as new fraction
```
(2/3) × (3/4) = 6/12
```

### Step 4: Simplify
```
6/12 = 1/2  (divide both by 6)
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
```
2/3 ≈ 0.67 and 3/4 = 0.75
0.67 × 0.75 ≈ 0.50 = 1/2 ✓
```

## Simplifying BEFORE Multiplying (Canceling)

You can simplify before multiplying to make the math easier:

**Example:** (4/9) × (3/8)

```
Method 1: Multiply then simplify
(4 × 3)/(9 × 8) = 12/72 = 1/6

Method 2: Cancel first (easier!)
4 and 8 share factor 4:  4/8 = 1/2
3 and 9 share factor 3:  3/9 = 1/3

(4/9) × (3/8) = (1/3) × (1/2) = 1/6
```

Both methods give same answer, but canceling first is faster!

## More Examples

### Example 1: Simple multiplication
**Multiply:** (1/5) × (2/7)

```
Numerators: 1 × 2 = 2
Denominators: 5 × 7 = 35

Answer: 2/35 (already simplified)
```

**Check:** Both fractions small, so answer should be small ✓

### Example 2: With whole number
**Multiply:** (3/4) × 6

```
Step 1: Write 6 as fraction
6 = 6/1

Step 2: Multiply
(3/4) × (6/1) = (3 × 6)/(4 × 1) = 18/4

Step 3: Simplify
18/4 = 9/2 = 4½
```

**Check:** 3/4 of 6 = 4.5 ✓

### Example 3: Canceling before multiplying
**Multiply:** (5/6) × (4/15)

```
Cancel common factors:
5 and 15 share 5:  5/15 = 1/3
4 and 6 share 2:   4/6 = 2/3

(5/6) × (4/15) = (1/3) × (2/3) = 2/9
```

**Check without canceling:**
```
(5 × 4)/(6 × 15) = 20/90 = 2/9 ✓
```

### Example 4: Three fractions
**Multiply:** (1/2) × (2/3) × (3/4)

```
Notice: 2s and 3s cancel!
(1/2) × (2/3) × (3/4) = (1 × 2 × 3)/(2 × 3 × 4)

Cancel:
= (1 × 1 × 1)/(1 × 1 × 4)
= 1/4
```

**Check:** (1/2)(2/3) = 1/3, then (1/3)(3/4) = 1/4 ✓

### Example 5: Mixed numbers
**Multiply:** 2½ × 1⅓

```
Step 1: Convert to improper fractions
2½ = 5/2
1⅓ = 4/3

Step 2: Multiply
(5/2) × (4/3) = 20/6

Step 3: Simplify
20/6 = 10/3 = 3⅓
```

**Check:** 2.5 × 1.33 ≈ 3.33 ✓

## Fraction of a Fraction

"Of" means multiply:

**Example:** What is 1/2 of 1/4?

```
1/2 × 1/4 = 1/8
```

**Visual:** If you take half of a quarter, you get an eighth.

**Example:** What is 2/3 of 3/4?

```
2/3 × 3/4 = 6/12 = 1/2
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Multiply straight across** - Numerator × numerator, denominator × denominator
✓ **No common denominator needed** - Unlike addition/subtraction
✓ **Whole numbers become n/1** - Any number over 1
✓ **Cancel before multiplying** - Makes calculations easier
✓ **Always simplify** - Reduce to lowest terms
✓ **"Of" means multiply** - In word problems

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Cross-multiplying** - Wrong: (1/2) × (1/3) = 3/2
✓ Correct: (1/2) × (1/3) = 1/6 (multiply straight across)

❌ **Adding instead of multiplying** - Wrong: (2/3) × (1/4) = 3/7
✓ Correct: (2/3) × (1/4) = 2/12 = 1/6

❌ **Not simplifying** - Wrong: Leaving answer as 4/8
✓ Correct: 4/8 = 1/2

❌ **Multiplying mixed numbers directly** - Wrong: 2½ × 3 = 6½
✓ Correct: 5/2 × 3 = 15/2 = 7½ (convert to improper first)
