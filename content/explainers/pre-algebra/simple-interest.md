# Simple Interest

## What is Simple Interest?

Simple interest is money earned (or paid) on a principal amount over time. It's calculated only on the original principal, not on accumulated interest.

**Formula:** I = Prt

Where:
- **I** = Interest earned/paid
- **P** = Principal (starting amount)
- **r** = Interest rate (as decimal)
- **t** = Time (usually in years)

Example: $1,000 at 5% for 2 years earns $100 interest

## Understanding the Variables

### Principal (P)
The original amount of money invested or borrowed
- Savings account: amount deposited
- Loan: amount borrowed

### Rate (r)
The percent of interest per year, written as decimal
- 5% = 0.05
- 12% = 0.12
- 0.5% = 0.005

### Time (t)
The length of time, usually in years
- 2 years = 2
- 6 months = 0.5 years
- 3 months = 0.25 years

### Interest (I)
The money earned or owed
- Always positive
- Added to principal for total

## How to Calculate Simple Interest

Follow these steps:

1. **Identify P, r, t** - Note given values
2. **Convert rate to decimal** - Divide percent by 100
3. **Convert time to years** - If needed
4. **Substitute into formula** - I = Prt
5. **Calculate** - Multiply the values
6. **Find total** - Add interest to principal (if asked)

## Step-by-Step Example

**Problem:** You invest $2,000 at 6% simple interest for 3 years. How much interest do you earn?

### Step 1: Identify values
```
P = $2,000 (principal)
r = 6% (rate)
t = 3 years (time)
```

### Step 2: Convert rate to decimal
```
r = 6% = 6/100 = 0.06
```

### Step 3: Use formula I = Prt
```
I = $2,000 × 0.06 × 3
```

### Step 4: Calculate
```
I = $2,000 × 0.06 × 3
I = $360
```

### Step 5: Answer
```
Interest earned = $360
Total amount = $2,000 + $360 = $2,360
```

### Check your answer
```
Each year: $2,000 × 0.06 = $120
3 years: $120 × 3 = $360 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 1: Finding total amount
**You borrow $5,000 at 8% for 2 years. What do you owe?**

```
P = $5,000
r = 8% = 0.08
t = 2 years

I = Prt
I = $5,000 × 0.08 × 2
I = $800

Total owed = $5,000 + $800 = $5,800
```

**Check:** $5,000 × 0.08 = $400/year; $400 × 2 = $800 ✓

### Example 2: Time in months
**Invest $1,500 at 4% for 9 months. How much interest?**

```
P = $1,500
r = 4% = 0.04
t = 9 months = 9/12 = 0.75 years

I = $1,500 × 0.04 × 0.75
I = $45
```

**Check:** Full year would be $60; 9 months = 3/4 year = $45 ✓

### Example 3: Finding the rate
**$3,000 earns $450 interest in 3 years. What's the rate?**

```
P = $3,000
I = $450
t = 3 years
r = ?

I = Prt
$450 = $3,000 × r × 3
$450 = $9,000r
r = $450 ÷ $9,000
r = 0.05 = 5%
```

**Check:** $3,000 × 0.05 × 3 = $450 ✓

### Example 4: Finding the principal
**At 6% for 4 years, you earn $720 interest. What was principal?**

```
I = $720
r = 6% = 0.06
t = 4 years
P = ?

I = Prt
$720 = P × 0.06 × 4
$720 = P × 0.24
P = $720 ÷ 0.24
P = $3,000
```

**Check:** $3,000 × 0.06 × 4 = $720 ✓

### Example 5: Finding the time
**$2,000 at 5% earns $300 interest. How long?**

```
P = $2,000
r = 5% = 0.05
I = $300
t = ?

I = Prt
$300 = $2,000 × 0.05 × t
$300 = $100t
t = $300 ÷ $100
t = 3 years
```

**Check:** $2,000 × 0.05 × 3 = $300 ✓

## Simple vs Compound Interest

**Simple interest:** Calculated only on principal
- Year 1: $1,000 × 0.05 = $50
- Year 2: $1,000 × 0.05 = $50
- Year 3: $1,000 × 0.05 = $50
- Total: $150

**Compound interest:** Calculated on principal + accumulated interest
- Year 1: $1,000 × 0.05 = $50 (total: $1,050)
- Year 2: $1,050 × 0.05 = $52.50 (total: $1,102.50)
- Year 3: $1,102.50 × 0.05 = $55.13 (total: $1,157.63)
- Total: $157.63

Compound grows faster!

## Real-World Applications

### Savings Account
**Deposit $1,000 at 3% for 5 years**
```
I = $1,000 × 0.03 × 5 = $150
Total = $1,150
```

### Car Loan
**Borrow $15,000 at 7% for 4 years**
```
I = $15,000 × 0.07 × 4 = $4,200
Total to repay = $19,200
```

### Credit Card
**Owe $500 at 18% for 1 month (interest only)**
```
I = $500 × 0.18 × (1/12)
I = $500 × 0.18 × 0.0833
I ≈ $7.50
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **I = Prt formula** - Memorize this!
✓ **Rate as decimal** - Always convert percent: 5% → 0.05
✓ **Time in years** - Convert months: divide by 12
✓ **Interest adds to principal** - For total amount
✓ **Simple = constant** - Same interest each period
✓ **Check your work** - Multiply yearly interest by number of years

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting to convert rate** - Wrong: Using 5 instead of 0.05
✓ Correct: 5% = 0.05

❌ **Wrong time units** - Wrong: Using months directly
✓ Correct: 6 months = 0.5 years

❌ **Confusing I and total** - Wrong: Saying interest is final amount
✓ Correct: Total = Principal + Interest

❌ **Wrong variable** - Wrong: I = Prt → P = I - rt
✓ Correct: P = I ÷ (rt)
