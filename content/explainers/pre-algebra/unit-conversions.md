# Unit Conversions

## What are Unit Conversions?

Unit conversions involve changing a measurement from one unit to another while keeping the same quantity. We use conversion factors (ratios equal to 1) to convert between units.

**Key idea:** Multiplying by a conversion factor doesn't change the value, just the units.

Examples:
- 12 inches = 1 foot
- 1000 meters = 1 kilometer
- 16 ounces = 1 pound

## Common Conversion Factors

### Length (US Customary)
```
12 inches (in) = 1 foot (ft)
3 feet = 1 yard (yd)
5,280 feet = 1 mile (mi)
1,760 yards = 1 mile
```

### Length (Metric)
```
10 millimeters (mm) = 1 centimeter (cm)
100 centimeters = 1 meter (m)
1000 meters = 1 kilometer (km)
```

### Weight/Mass (US Customary)
```
16 ounces (oz) = 1 pound (lb)
2,000 pounds = 1 ton (T)
```

### Weight/Mass (Metric)
```
1000 milligrams (mg) = 1 gram (g)
1000 grams = 1 kilogram (kg)
```

### Volume (US Customary)
```
8 fluid ounces = 1 cup (c)
2 cups = 1 pint (pt)
2 pints = 1 quart (qt)
4 quarts = 1 gallon (gal)
```

### Volume (Metric)
```
1000 milliliters (mL) = 1 liter (L)
```

### Time
```
60 seconds (sec) = 1 minute (min)
60 minutes = 1 hour (hr)
24 hours = 1 day
7 days = 1 week
```

## How to Convert Units

Follow these steps:

1. **Identify conversion factor** - Find relationship between units
2. **Write as fraction** - Put desired unit on top
3. **Multiply** - Units cancel, leaving desired unit
4. **Simplify** - Calculate final answer
5. **Check** - Verify answer makes sense

## Step-by-Step Example

**Convert:** 36 inches to feet

### Step 1: Identify conversion factor
```
12 inches = 1 foot
```

### Step 2: Set up fraction with desired unit on top
```
36 inches × (1 foot / 12 inches)
```

### Step 3: Cancel units
```
36 inches × (1 foot / 12 inches)
Inches cancel out
```

### Step 4: Calculate
```
36 × (1/12) = 3 feet
```

### Step 5: Check
```
3 feet × 12 = 36 inches ✓
Answer is reasonable (feet < inches for same length)
```

## More Examples

### Example 1: Meters to centimeters
**Convert:** 2.5 meters to centimeters

```
Conversion: 1 meter = 100 centimeters

2.5 meters × (100 cm / 1 meter)
= 2.5 × 100
= 250 centimeters
```

**Check:** Going to smaller unit = bigger number ✓

### Example 2: Hours to minutes
**Convert:** 3.5 hours to minutes

```
Conversion: 1 hour = 60 minutes

3.5 hours × (60 min / 1 hour)
= 3.5 × 60
= 210 minutes
```

**Check:** 3 hours = 180 min, plus 30 min = 210 min ✓

### Example 3: Ounces to pounds
**Convert:** 48 ounces to pounds

```
Conversion: 16 ounces = 1 pound

48 ounces × (1 lb / 16 oz)
= 48/16
= 3 pounds
```

**Check:** 3 × 16 = 48 ✓

## Multi-Step Conversions

Sometimes you need multiple conversion factors.

### Example 4: Miles to feet
**Convert:** 2 miles to feet

```
Method 1: Direct (if you know it)
2 miles × (5,280 ft / 1 mile) = 10,560 feet

Method 2: Through yards
2 miles × (1,760 yd / 1 mile) × (3 ft / 1 yd)
= 2 × 1,760 × 3
= 10,560 feet
```

**Both give same answer:** 10,560 feet ✓

### Example 5: Days to seconds
**Convert:** 1 day to seconds

```
Chain conversions:
1 day × (24 hr / 1 day) × (60 min / 1 hr) × (60 sec / 1 min)

= 1 × 24 × 60 × 60
= 86,400 seconds
```

**Check:** 24 hours, each 3,600 seconds ✓

### Example 6: Mixed units
**Convert:** 5 feet 7 inches to inches

```
Step 1: Convert feet to inches
5 feet × (12 in / 1 ft) = 60 inches

Step 2: Add remaining inches
60 + 7 = 67 inches
```

**Check:** 67 ÷ 12 = 5 remainder 7 ✓

## Metric Conversions

Metric is based on powers of 10 (easier!):

**Moving up (to larger units):** Divide
**Moving down (to smaller units):** Multiply

### Example 7: Kilometers to meters
**Convert:** 3.2 km to meters

```
1 km = 1000 m (larger to smaller = multiply)
3.2 × 1000 = 3,200 meters
```

### Example 8: Grams to kilograms
**Convert:** 2,500 g to kilograms

```
1000 g = 1 kg (smaller to larger = divide)
2,500 ÷ 1000 = 2.5 kilograms
```

## Rate Conversions

**Example 9:** 60 miles per hour to feet per second

```
60 miles/hour × (5,280 ft/1 mile) × (1 hour/60 min) × (1 min/60 sec)

= (60 × 5,280) / (60 × 60)
= 316,800 / 3,600
= 88 feet per second
```

## Dimensional Analysis

Set up conversions so units cancel:

**Example:** Convert 50 mph to ft/sec

```
50 miles   5,280 feet   1 hour     1 minute
-------- × ---------- × -------- × --------
1 hour      1 mile      60 min    60 sec

Miles cancel, hours cancel, minutes cancel
= (50 × 5,280) / (60 × 60) ft/sec
≈ 73.3 ft/sec
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Conversion factors equal 1** - So they don't change the value
✓ **Units must cancel** - Set up fraction to cancel unwanted units
✓ **Desired unit on top** - Arrange fraction properly
✓ **Check reasonableness** - Smaller units = larger numbers
✓ **Metric is powers of 10** - Just move decimal point
✓ **Chain conversions** - Can use multiple steps

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Upside-down fraction** - Wrong: 12 in × (12 in/1 ft) = 144 in
✓ Correct: 12 in × (1 ft/12 in) = 1 ft

❌ **Wrong operation** - Wrong: Dividing when should multiply
✓ Correct: Check if going to smaller (×) or larger (÷) units

❌ **Not canceling units** - Wrong: Leaving units mixed up
✓ Correct: Make sure units cancel properly

❌ **Decimal errors in metric** - Wrong: 5 km = 50 m
✓ Correct: 5 km = 5,000 m (multiply by 1000)
