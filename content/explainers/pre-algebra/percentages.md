# Percentages and Applications

## What is a Percentage?

A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. The word "percent" means "per hundred" or "out of 100".

**Notation:** % (percent symbol)

**Meaning:** x% = x/100

Examples:
- 50% = 50/100 = 1/2 = 0.5
- 25% = 25/100 = 1/4 = 0.25
- 100% = 100/100 = 1 (the whole)

## Converting Between Forms

### Percent to Decimal
**Divide by 100** (move decimal 2 places left)
```
45% = 45/100 = 0.45
7% = 7/100 = 0.07
125% = 125/100 = 1.25
```

### Decimal to Percent
**Multiply by 100** (move decimal 2 places right)
```
0.35 = 35%
0.08 = 8%
1.5 = 150%
```

### Percent to Fraction
**Write over 100 and simplify**
```
40% = 40/100 = 2/5
75% = 75/100 = 3/4
20% = 20/100 = 1/5
```

### Fraction to Percent
**Divide numerator by denominator, multiply by 100**
```
1/2 = 0.5 = 50%
3/4 = 0.75 = 75%
1/8 = 0.125 = 12.5%
```

## Common Percentage Problems

There are three types of percent problems:

1. **Finding the part:** What is 30% of 50?
2. **Finding the percent:** What percent of 50 is 15?
3. **Finding the whole:** 30% of what number is 15?

## Type 1: Finding the Part

**Question:** What is 25% of 80?

**Formula:** Part = Percent × Whole

### Step-by-Step Solution

```
Step 1: Convert percent to decimal
25% = 0.25

Step 2: Multiply
0.25 × 80 = 20

Answer: 20
```

**Check:** 20/80 = 1/4 = 25% ✓

## Type 2: Finding the Percent

**Question:** What percent of 40 is 10?

**Formula:** Percent = (Part ÷ Whole) × 100

### Step-by-Step Solution

```
Step 1: Divide part by whole
10 ÷ 40 = 0.25

Step 2: Convert to percent
0.25 × 100 = 25%

Answer: 25%
```

**Check:** 25% of 40 = 0.25 × 40 = 10 ✓

## Type 3: Finding the Whole

**Question:** 20% of what number is 15?

**Formula:** Whole = Part ÷ Percent

### Step-by-Step Solution

```
Step 1: Convert percent to decimal
20% = 0.20

Step 2: Divide
15 ÷ 0.20 = 75

Answer: 75
```

**Check:** 20% of 75 = 0.20 × 75 = 15 ✓

## Percent Increase and Decrease

### Percent Increase
**Find the change, divide by original, multiply by 100**

**Example:** Price increases from $40 to $50

```
Change = 50 - 40 = 10
Percent = (10 ÷ 40) × 100 = 25%

The price increased by 25%
```

### Percent Decrease
**Same formula, but for decrease**

**Example:** Price decreases from $50 to $40

```
Change = 50 - 40 = 10
Percent = (10 ÷ 50) × 100 = 20%

The price decreased by 20%
```

**Note:** 25% increase ≠ 25% decrease (different starting points!)

## Real-World Applications

### Sales Tax
**Example:** Item costs $60, tax is 8%

```
Tax = 8% of $60
    = 0.08 × 60
    = $4.80

Total = $60 + $4.80 = $64.80
```

### Discount
**Example:** Shirt is $40, on sale for 30% off

```
Discount = 30% of $40
         = 0.30 × 40
         = $12

Sale price = $40 - $12 = $28
```

**Shortcut:** 30% off = pay 70%
```
Sale price = 70% of $40
           = 0.70 × 40
           = $28
```

### Tips
**Example:** Meal costs $45, leave 20% tip

```
Tip = 20% of $45
    = 0.20 × 45
    = $9

Total = $45 + $9 = $54
```

**Shortcut:** 20% = double 10%
```
10% of $45 = $4.50
20% = 2 × $4.50 = $9
```

## More Examples

### Example 1: Test grade
**You got 17 out of 20 correct. What's your percent?**

```
Percent = (17 ÷ 20) × 100
        = 0.85 × 100
        = 85%
```

### Example 2: Population growth
**Town had 5,000 people, now has 5,500. What's the percent increase?**

```
Change = 5,500 - 5,000 = 500
Percent = (500 ÷ 5,000) × 100
        = 0.10 × 100
        = 10%

Population increased by 10%
```

### Example 3: Finding original price
**After 25% discount, shirt costs $30. What was original price?**

```
$30 is 75% of original (100% - 25% = 75%)
Original = 30 ÷ 0.75
         = $40
```

**Check:** 25% of $40 = $10; $40 - $10 = $30 ✓

## Helpful Percent Equivalents

**Common fractions:**
```
1/2 = 50%      1/4 = 25%      3/4 = 75%
1/3 ≈ 33.3%    2/3 ≈ 66.7%
1/5 = 20%      2/5 = 40%      3/5 = 60%      4/5 = 80%
1/10 = 10%     1/8 = 12.5%    1/20 = 5%
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Percent means per 100** - 50% = 50 per 100 = 50/100
✓ **Move decimal 2 places** - To convert between percent and decimal
✓ **"Of" means multiply** - 25% of 80 = 0.25 × 80
✓ **Part = Percent × Whole** - Main formula to remember
✓ **Percent change = (Change ÷ Original) × 100** - For increases/decreases
✓ **Can be > 100%** - 150% = 1.5 (more than the whole)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting to convert** - Wrong: 25% of 80 = 25 × 80 = 2000
✓ Correct: 0.25 × 80 = 20

❌ **Wrong base for percent change** - Wrong: Using new value instead of original
✓ Correct: Always divide change by ORIGINAL value

❌ **Adding percents incorrectly** - Wrong: 50% + 50% = 100% of original
✓ Correct: 50% increase, then 50% decrease ≠ back to original

❌ **Decimal point errors** - Wrong: 5% = 0.5
✓ Correct: 5% = 0.05 (move 2 places, not 1)
