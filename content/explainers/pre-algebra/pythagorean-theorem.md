# Pythagorean Theorem

## What is the Pythagorean Theorem?

The Pythagorean Theorem is a fundamental relationship between the sides of a right triangle. It states that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

**Formula:** a² + b² = c²

Where:
- **a** and **b** = legs (shorter sides)
- **c** = hypotenuse (longest side, opposite right angle)

**Important:** Only works for RIGHT triangles (one 90° angle)!

Examples:
- 3² + 4² = 5² → 9 + 16 = 25 ✓
- 5² + 12² = 13² → 25 + 144 = 169 ✓
- 8² + 15² = 17² → 64 + 225 = 289 ✓

## Understanding the Triangle

**Right triangle parts:**
```
        |\
        | \
      a |  \ c (hypotenuse)
        |   \
        |____\
          b
```

- **Right angle:** The 90° angle (marked with small square)
- **Legs:** The two sides forming the right angle (a and b)
- **Hypotenuse:** The side opposite the right angle (c) - always longest!

## How to Use the Theorem

Follow these steps:

1. **Identify the triangle type** - Make sure it's a right triangle
2. **Label the sides** - Identify hypotenuse (c) and legs (a, b)
3. **Substitute into formula** - a² + b² = c²
4. **Solve** - Calculate the unknown side
5. **Take square root** - If solving for a side (not its square)
6. **Check** - Verify answer makes sense

## Step-by-Step Example (Finding Hypotenuse)

**Problem:** A right triangle has legs of 6 and 8. Find the hypotenuse.

### Step 1: Identify values
```
a = 6 (leg)
b = 8 (leg)
c = ? (hypotenuse)
```

### Step 2: Use formula a² + b² = c²
```
6² + 8² = c²
```

### Step 3: Calculate squares
```
36 + 64 = c²
100 = c²
```

### Step 4: Take square root
```
c = √100
c = 10
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
```
6² + 8² = 10²
36 + 64 = 100
100 = 100 ✓

Also: 10 > 8 and 10 > 6 (hypotenuse is longest) ✓
```

## Step-by-Step Example (Finding a Leg)

**Problem:** Hypotenuse is 13, one leg is 5. Find the other leg.

### Step 1: Identify values
```
a = 5 (known leg)
b = ? (unknown leg)
c = 13 (hypotenuse)
```

### Step 2: Use formula a² + b² = c²
```
5² + b² = 13²
```

### Step 3: Calculate squares
```
25 + b² = 169
```

### Step 4: Solve for b²
```
b² = 169 - 25
b² = 144
```

### Step 5: Take square root
```
b = √144
b = 12
```

### Check
```
5² + 12² = 13²
25 + 144 = 169
169 = 169 ✓
```

## Common Pythagorean Triples

These are sets of three whole numbers that satisfy a² + b² = c²:

**Basic triples:**
- 3, 4, 5 (most common)
- 5, 12, 13
- 8, 15, 17
- 7, 24, 25

**Multiples also work:**
- 6, 8, 10 (2× the 3, 4, 5)
- 9, 12, 15 (3× the 3, 4, 5)
- 10, 24, 26 (2× the 5, 12, 13)

Recognizing these saves time!

## More Examples

### Example 1: Using a Pythagorean triple
**Triangle has legs 9 and 12. Find hypotenuse.**

```
Notice: 9 and 12 are 3× the triple (3, 4, 5)
So hypotenuse is 3 × 5 = 15

Check:
9² + 12² = 15²
81 + 121 = 225
225 = 225 ✓
```

### Example 2: Non-integer answer
**Legs are 5 and 7. Find hypotenuse.**

```
a² + b² = c²
5² + 7² = c²
25 + 49 = c²
74 = c²
c = √74 ≈ 8.6
```

**Check:** (8.6)² ≈ 74 ✓

### Example 3: Real-world application
**Ladder is 10 ft long, base is 6 ft from wall. How high does it reach?**

```
c = 10 (ladder/hypotenuse)
a = 6 (base/one leg)
b = ? (height/other leg)

6² + b² = 10²
36 + b² = 100
b² = 64
b = 8

Ladder reaches 8 feet high
```

### Example 4: Distance between points
**Find distance from (0,0) to (3,4) on coordinate plane.**

```
Horizontal distance: 3
Vertical distance: 4

3² + 4² = c²
9 + 16 = c²
25 = c²
c = 5

Distance is 5 units
```

This is the 3-4-5 triple!

## Verifying a Right Triangle

Use the theorem backwards: if a² + b² = c², then triangle is right.

**Example:** Is a triangle with sides 10, 24, 26 a right triangle?

```
Check if 10² + 24² = 26²
100 + 576 = 676
676 = 676 ✓

Yes, it's a right triangle!
```

**Example:** Is a triangle with sides 5, 6, 7 a right triangle?

```
Check if 5² + 6² = 7²
25 + 36 = 49
61 ≠ 49 ✗

No, not a right triangle
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Right triangles only** - Must have a 90° angle
✓ **c is always hypotenuse** - Longest side, opposite right angle
✓ **Order of a and b doesn't matter** - Both are legs
✓ **Perfect squares** - Memorize: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144...
✓ **Pythagorean triples** - Recognize common patterns
✓ **Can verify right triangles** - Check if a² + b² = c²

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Using wrong side as c** - Wrong: Using a leg as hypotenuse
✓ Correct: c is ALWAYS the longest side

❌ **Forgetting to square** - Wrong: a + b = c
✓ Correct: a² + b² = c²

❌ **Not taking square root** - Wrong: Leaving answer as c² = 25
✓ Correct: c = √25 = 5

❌ **Wrong operation when solving** - Wrong: a² + b² = c² → a² = c² + b²
✓ Correct: a² = c² - b²
