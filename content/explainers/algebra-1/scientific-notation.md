# Scientific Notation

## What is Scientific Notation?

Scientific notation is a way to write very large or very small numbers more compactly. It expresses numbers as a product of a decimal and a power of 10.

**Format:** a × 10^n

Where:
- **a** = a number between 1 and 10 (1 ≤ a < 10)
- **n** = an integer (positive or negative)

Examples:
- 5,000,000 = 5 × 10⁶
- 0.00003 = 3 × 10^(-5)
- 6.02 × 10²³ (Avogadro's number)

## Why Use Scientific Notation?

**Benefits:**
- Easier to read very large/small numbers
- Simpler to multiply and divide
- Shows precision clearly
- Standard in science and engineering

Compare:
- Regular: 299,792,458 m/s (speed of light)
- Scientific: 2.998 × 10⁸ m/s ✓ Much clearer!

## How to Convert TO Scientific Notation

Follow these steps:

1. **Move decimal point** - Place it after first non-zero digit
2. **Count moves** - Number of places moved is the exponent
3. **Determine sign** - Positive for large numbers, negative for small
4. **Write in form** - a × 10^n

### For Large Numbers (≥ 10):
Move decimal LEFT → positive exponent

### For Small Numbers (< 1):
Move decimal RIGHT → negative exponent

## Step-by-Step Example (Large Number)

**Convert to scientific notation:** 45,000

### Step 1: Place decimal after first digit
```
45,000 → 4.5000
```

### Step 2: Count decimal places moved
```
4.5000 (moved 4 places left)
```

### Step 3: Write with positive exponent
```
45,000 = 4.5 × 10⁴
```

### Step 4: Check your answer
```
4.5 × 10⁴ = 4.5 × 10,000 = 45,000 ✓
```

## Step-by-Step Example (Small Number)

**Convert to scientific notation:** 0.00067

### Step 1: Place decimal after first non-zero digit
```
0.00067 → 6.7
```

### Step 2: Count decimal places moved
```
Moved 4 places RIGHT
```

### Step 3: Write with negative exponent
```
0.00067 = 6.7 × 10^(-4)
```

### Step 4: Check your answer
```
6.7 × 10^(-4) = 6.7 × 0.0001 = 0.00067 ✓
```

## Converting FROM Scientific Notation

Move decimal point based on exponent:

**Positive exponent:** Move decimal RIGHT (makes larger)
**Negative exponent:** Move decimal LEFT (makes smaller)

### Example 1: Positive exponent
**Convert:** 3.2 × 10⁵

```
Move decimal 5 places right:
3.2 × 10⁵ = 320,000
```

### Example 2: Negative exponent
**Convert:** 8.1 × 10^(-3)

```
Move decimal 3 places left:
8.1 × 10^(-3) = 0.0081
```

## Operations with Scientific Notation

### Multiplication
**Multiply the decimals, ADD the exponents:**

```
(2 × 10³) × (4 × 10⁵)
= (2 × 4) × 10^(3+5)
= 8 × 10⁸
```

### Division
**Divide the decimals, SUBTRACT the exponents:**

```
(6 × 10⁷) ÷ (2 × 10³)
= (6 ÷ 2) × 10^(7-3)
= 3 × 10⁴
```

### Addition/Subtraction
**Must have SAME exponent first:**

```
(3 × 10⁴) + (5 × 10⁴)
= (3 + 5) × 10⁴
= 8 × 10⁴

But for different exponents:
(4 × 10⁵) + (2 × 10⁴)
= (40 × 10⁴) + (2 × 10⁴)  [adjust to same power]
= 42 × 10⁴
= 4.2 × 10⁵  [adjust to proper form]
```

## More Examples

### Example 3: Very large number
**Convert:** 93,000,000 miles (Earth to Sun)

```
Move decimal 7 places left:
93,000,000 = 9.3 × 10⁷ miles
```

### Example 4: Very small number
**Convert:** 0.000000001 meters (1 nanometer)

```
Move decimal 9 places right:
0.000000001 = 1 × 10^(-9) meters
```

### Example 5: Multiplication example
**Calculate:** (3 × 10⁸) × (2 × 10^(-5))

```
Multiply decimals: 3 × 2 = 6
Add exponents: 8 + (-5) = 3

Answer: 6 × 10³ = 6,000
```

### Example 6: Division example
**Calculate:** (8 × 10⁶) ÷ (4 × 10²)

```
Divide decimals: 8 ÷ 4 = 2
Subtract exponents: 6 - 2 = 4

Answer: 2 × 10⁴ = 20,000
```

## Adjusting to Proper Form

Sometimes calculations give results not in proper form (a should be 1 ≤ a < 10):

**Example:** 45 × 10³

```
45 is too large (≥ 10)
Move decimal left once: 4.5
Increase exponent by 1: 10⁴

Proper form: 4.5 × 10⁴
```

**Example:** 0.3 × 10⁵

```
0.3 is too small (< 1)
Move decimal right once: 3
Decrease exponent by 1: 10⁴

Proper form: 3 × 10⁴
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Decimal between 1 and 10** - First number must be 1 ≤ a < 10
✓ **Left = positive** - Moving decimal left gives positive exponent
✓ **Right = negative** - Moving decimal right gives negative exponent
✓ **Multiply/divide is easy** - Just add/subtract exponents
✓ **Count carefully** - Number of moves = exponent value
✓ **Check if reasonable** - 10³ = 1,000, 10⁶ = 1,000,000

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong direction** - Wrong: 500 = 5 × 10^(-2)
✓ Correct: 500 = 5 × 10²

❌ **Decimal not in range** - Wrong: 0.5 × 10⁴ (should be 5 × 10³)
✓ Correct: First number must be ≥ 1 and < 10

❌ **Multiplying exponents** - Wrong: (2 × 10³)(3 × 10⁴) = 6 × 10¹²
✓ Correct: Add exponents: 6 × 10⁷

❌ **Forgetting to adjust** - Wrong: Leaving answer as 25 × 10⁶
✓ Correct: Adjust to 2.5 × 10⁷
