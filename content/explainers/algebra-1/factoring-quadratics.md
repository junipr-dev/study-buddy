# Factoring Quadratic Expressions

## What is Factoring Quadratics?

Factoring a quadratic expression means writing it as a product of two binomials (expressions with two terms). It's the reverse of using the distributive property.

**General pattern:** x² + bx + c = (x + m)(x + n)

Where m and n are numbers that:
- **Multiply** to give c: m × n = c
- **Add** to give b: m + n = b

Examples:
- x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
- x² - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3)
- x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)

## How to Factor

Follow these steps:

1. **Check for GCF** - Factor out greatest common factor first
2. **Identify a, b, c** - From ax² + bx + c
3. **Find the numbers** - That multiply to c and add to b
4. **Write factors** - (x + m)(x + n)
5. **Check** - Multiply binomials to verify

## Step-by-Step Example

**Factor:** x² + 7x + 12

### Step 1: Identify a, b, c
```
a = 1 (coefficient of x²)
b = 7 (coefficient of x)
c = 12 (constant)
```

### Step 2: Find two numbers
Need numbers that:
- Multiply to 12: m × n = 12
- Add to 7: m + n = 7

Try factor pairs of 12:
```
1 × 12 = 12,  1 + 12 = 13  ✗
2 × 6 = 12,   2 + 6 = 8    ✗
3 × 4 = 12,   3 + 4 = 7    ✓
```

### Step 3: Write the factors
```
m = 3, n = 4
x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)
```

### Step 4: Check by multiplying
```
(x + 3)(x + 4)
= x² + 4x + 3x + 12
= x² + 7x + 12 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Negative middle term
**Factor:** x² - 8x + 15

```
Need: m × n = 15 and m + n = -8
Both must be negative!

Try:
-1 × -15 = 15,  -1 + -15 = -16  ✗
-3 × -5 = 15,   -3 + -5 = -8    ✓

Factor: (x - 3)(x - 5)
```

**Check:** (x - 3)(x - 5) = x² - 5x - 3x + 15 = x² - 8x + 15 ✓

### Example 3: Negative constant term
**Factor:** x² + 2x - 15

```
Need: m × n = -15 and m + n = 2
One must be positive, one negative!

Try:
1 × -15 = -15,   1 + -15 = -14  ✗
3 × -5 = -15,    3 + -5 = -2    ✗
5 × -3 = -15,    5 + -3 = 2     ✓

Factor: (x + 5)(x - 3)
```

**Check:** (x + 5)(x - 3) = x² - 3x + 5x - 15 = x² + 2x - 15 ✓

### Example 4: Difference of squares
**Factor:** x² - 25

```
This is a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

x² - 25 = x² - 5²
        = (x + 5)(x - 5)
```

**Check:** (x + 5)(x - 5) = x² - 5x + 5x - 25 = x² - 25 ✓

### Example 5: Factor out GCF first
**Factor:** 2x² + 10x + 12

```
GCF of all terms is 2:
2x² + 10x + 12 = 2(x² + 5x + 6)

Now factor the quadratic:
Need: m × n = 6, m + n = 5
2 × 3 = 6,  2 + 3 = 5 ✓

Final: 2(x + 2)(x + 3)
```

**Check:** 2(x + 2)(x + 3) = 2(x² + 5x + 6) = 2x² + 10x + 12 ✓

## Special Patterns to Recognize

### Perfect Square Trinomial
```
x² + 2ax + a² = (x + a)²
x² - 2ax + a² = (x - a)²

Example: x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²
```

### Difference of Squares
```
a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

Example: x² - 49 = (x + 7)(x - 7)
```

### Sum of Squares
```
x² + 25 CANNOT be factored (over real numbers)
```

## Sign Rules Summary

| c value | b value | Factors m and n |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| + | + | Both positive |
| + | - | Both negative |
| - | + | One positive (larger), one negative |
| - | - | One negative (larger), one positive |

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **GCF first** - Always check for common factors
✓ **Multiply to c, add to b** - Key pattern to remember
✓ **Watch the signs** - Positive/negative affects the factors
✓ **Check your work** - Multiply back to verify
✓ **Special patterns** - Recognize difference of squares, perfect squares
✓ **Prime quadratics** - Some cannot be factored (use quadratic formula)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong signs** - Wrong: x² - 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
✓ Correct: x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)

❌ **Forgetting GCF** - Wrong: 2x² + 8x + 6 = (2x + 2)(x + 3)
✓ Correct: 2x² + 8x + 6 = 2(x + 1)(x + 3)

❌ **Adding to c instead of b** - Need numbers that ADD to b coefficient
✓ Correct: For x² + 5x + 6, use 2 and 3 (add to 5, multiply to 6)

❌ **Not checking** - Always multiply factors to verify!
✓ Correct: FOIL to make sure you get original expression
