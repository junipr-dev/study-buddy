# Solving Systems of Equations

## What is a System of Equations?

A system of equations is two or more equations with the same variables. The solution is the point (x, y) that satisfies ALL equations at the same time - where the lines intersect on a graph.

**Example system:**
```
y = 2x + 1
y = -x + 4
```

The solution is the (x, y) pair that makes both equations true.

Types of solutions:
- **One solution** - Lines intersect at one point
- **No solution** - Parallel lines (never intersect)
- **Infinite solutions** - Same line (always intersect)

## Three Methods to Solve

### Method 1: Graphing
Plot both lines and find intersection point

### Method 2: Substitution
Substitute one equation into the other

### Method 3: Elimination
Add or subtract equations to eliminate a variable

## How to Solve by Substitution

Follow these steps:

1. **Solve one equation for a variable** - Usually easiest for y
2. **Substitute** - Replace that variable in other equation
3. **Solve for remaining variable** - Get a number value
4. **Back-substitute** - Find the other variable
5. **Check** - Verify in BOTH original equations

## Step-by-Step Example (Substitution)

**Solve the system:**
```
y = 2x + 1    (Equation 1)
y = -x + 4    (Equation 2)
```

### Step 1: Both equations already solved for y
Both are in the form y = ...

### Step 2: Set them equal (since both equal y)
```
2x + 1 = -x + 4
```

### Step 3: Solve for x
```
2x + 1 = -x + 4
2x + x = 4 - 1
3x = 3
x = 1
```

### Step 4: Substitute x = 1 into either equation
Using Equation 1:
```
y = 2(1) + 1
y = 2 + 1
y = 3
```

### Step 5: Solution is (1, 3)

### Check your answer
Equation 1: y = 2x + 1
```
3 = 2(1) + 1
3 = 3 ✓
```

Equation 2: y = -x + 4
```
3 = -(1) + 4
3 = 3 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Substitution with rearranging
**Solve:**
```
2x + y = 8     (Equation 1)
x - y = 1      (Equation 2)
```

```
Step 1: Solve Equation 2 for x
x = y + 1

Step 2: Substitute into Equation 1
2(y + 1) + y = 8
2y + 2 + y = 8
3y + 2 = 8
3y = 6
y = 2

Step 3: Back-substitute
x = y + 1
x = 2 + 1
x = 3

Solution: (3, 2)
```

**Check:** 2(3) + 2 = 8 ✓ and 3 - 2 = 1 ✓

### Example 3: Elimination method
**Solve:**
```
2x + 3y = 12   (Equation 1)
2x - y = 4     (Equation 2)
```

```
Step 1: Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1
(2x + 3y) - (2x - y) = 12 - 4
2x + 3y - 2x + y = 8
4y = 8
y = 2

Step 2: Substitute y = 2 into Equation 2
2x - 2 = 4
2x = 6
x = 3

Solution: (3, 2)
```

**Check:** 2(3) + 3(2) = 6 + 6 = 12 ✓ and 2(3) - 2 = 4 ✓

### Example 4: No solution (parallel lines)
**Solve:**
```
y = 2x + 3
y = 2x - 1
```

```
Set equal:
2x + 3 = 2x - 1
3 = -1    FALSE!

No solution (parallel lines - same slope, different y-intercepts)
```

### Example 5: Infinite solutions (same line)
**Solve:**
```
y = 3x + 2
2y = 6x + 4
```

```
Simplify Equation 2:
2y = 6x + 4
y = 3x + 2

This is the SAME as Equation 1!

Infinite solutions (same line)
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Solution satisfies ALL equations** - Must work in every equation
✓ **Three possible outcomes** - One solution, no solution, or infinite
✓ **Check your answer** - Substitute into both original equations
✓ **Choose easier method** - Substitution when one is solved for a variable
✓ **Elimination when coefficients match** - Or can be made to match
✓ **Graph to visualize** - Helps understand the solution

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Only checking one equation** - Wrong: Must check both
✓ Correct: Verify solution in ALL equations

❌ **Sign errors in elimination** - Wrong: (2x + y) - (x - y) = x
✓ Correct: (2x + y) - (x - y) = x + 2y

❌ **Forgetting to distribute** - Wrong: 2(x + 1) = 2x + 1
✓ Correct: 2(x + 1) = 2x + 2

❌ **Mixing up x and y** - Wrong: Solution (3, 2) means x=2, y=3
✓ Correct: (3, 2) means x=3, y=2
