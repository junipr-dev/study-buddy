# Solving Quadratic Equations

## What is a Quadratic Equation?

A quadratic equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 2 (x²). The standard form is ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0.

Unlike linear equations which have one solution, quadratic equations can have:
- **Two solutions** (most common)
- **One solution** (when both are the same)
- **No real solutions** (when solutions are imaginary)

Examples:
- x² - 5x + 6 = 0
- 2x² + 3x - 2 = 0
- x² - 9 = 0

## Methods to Solve Quadratics

There are several methods:

1. **Factoring** - Write as (x + a)(x + b) = 0
2. **Square Root Method** - For x² = k form
3. **Completing the Square** - Make a perfect square
4. **Quadratic Formula** - Works for all quadratics

## How to Solve by Factoring

Follow these steps:

1. **Write in standard form** - Get 0 on one side
2. **Factor the quadratic** - Write as product of binomials
3. **Apply zero product property** - If ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0
4. **Solve each factor** - Set each factor equal to 0
5. **Check** - Substitute solutions back into original

## Step-by-Step Example (Factoring)

**Solve:** x² - 5x + 6 = 0

### Step 1: Already in standard form
```
x² - 5x + 6 = 0
```

### Step 2: Factor the quadratic
Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5:
```
-2 × -3 = 6
-2 + -3 = -5 ✓

Factor: (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
```

### Step 3: Apply zero product property
If (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0, then either:
```
x - 2 = 0  OR  x - 3 = 0
```

### Step 4: Solve each equation
```
x - 2 = 0  →  x = 2
x - 3 = 0  →  x = 3
```

### Step 5: Solutions are x = 2 and x = 3

### Check your answers
For x = 2:
```
(2)² - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
```

For x = 3:
```
(3)² - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Square root method
**Solve:** x² = 25

```
Take square root of both sides:
x = ±√25
x = ±5

Two solutions: x = 5 or x = -5
```

**Check:**
```
(5)² = 25 ✓
(-5)² = 25 ✓
```

### Example 3: Difference of squares
**Solve:** x² - 16 = 0

```
Factor as difference of squares:
(x + 4)(x - 4) = 0

Set each factor to 0:
x + 4 = 0  →  x = -4
x - 4 = 0  →  x = 4

Solutions: x = -4 or x = 4
```

**Check:** (-4)² - 16 = 16 - 16 = 0 ✓

### Example 4: Factoring with leading coefficient
**Solve:** 2x² + 7x + 3 = 0

```
Factor: Find factors of 2×3=6 that add to 7
(2x + 1)(x + 3) = 0

Set each factor to 0:
2x + 1 = 0  →  2x = -1  →  x = -1/2
x + 3 = 0   →  x = -3

Solutions: x = -1/2 or x = -3
```

**Check for x = -1/2:**
```
2(-1/2)² + 7(-1/2) + 3 = 2(1/4) - 7/2 + 3 = 1/2 - 7/2 + 6/2 = 0 ✓
```

### Example 5: Perfect square trinomial
**Solve:** x² + 6x + 9 = 0

```
Factor as perfect square:
(x + 3)² = 0

Take square root:
x + 3 = 0
x = -3

Only one solution: x = -3 (repeated root)
```

**Check:** (-3)² + 6(-3) + 9 = 9 - 18 + 9 = 0 ✓

## When Factoring Doesn't Work Easily

If you can't factor easily, use the **Quadratic Formula**:

For ax² + bx + c = 0:
```
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)
```

**Example:** x² + 3x + 1 = 0 (doesn't factor nicely)
```
a = 1, b = 3, c = 1

x = [-3 ± √(9 - 4)] / 2
x = [-3 ± √5] / 2

x ≈ -0.38 or x ≈ -2.62
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Standard form first** - Always write as ax² + bx + c = 0
✓ **Two solutions (usually)** - Quadratics typically have two answers
✓ **Zero product property** - Key to factoring method
✓ **Check both solutions** - Verify each answer works
✓ **Plus-minus (±)** - Square root gives positive AND negative
✓ **Can't factor all** - Some require quadratic formula

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting ± sign** - Wrong: x² = 9 → x = 3
✓ Correct: x² = 9 → x = ±3 (x = 3 or x = -3)

❌ **Dividing by x** - Wrong: x² = 5x → x = 5
✓ Correct: x² - 5x = 0 → x(x - 5) = 0 → x = 0 or x = 5

❌ **Setting expression to x** - Wrong: (x - 2)(x + 3) = 0 → x = -2, 3
✓ Correct: x - 2 = 0 → x = 2; x + 3 = 0 → x = -3

❌ **Sign errors in factoring** - Check: (x + a)(x + b) = x² + (a+b)x + ab
✓ Correct: Verify factors multiply correctly
