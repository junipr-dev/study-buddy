# Solving Linear Inequalities

## What are Linear Inequalities?

A linear inequality is like a linear equation, but instead of an equal sign (=), it uses an inequality symbol. The solution is a range of values rather than a single number.

**Inequality symbols:**
- < (less than)
- > (greater than)
- ≤ (less than or equal to)
- ≥ (greater than or equal to)

Examples:
- 2x + 3 > 7
- 5x - 4 ≤ 11
- -3x < 9

## How to Solve

Follow these steps (very similar to equations):

1. **Identify the inequality** - Note which symbol is used
2. **Isolate the variable** - Use inverse operations
3. **Apply to both sides** - Keep inequality balanced
4. **Special rule** - Flip the symbol when multiplying/dividing by negative
5. **Graph the solution** - Show on a number line
6. **Check** - Test a value from your solution region

## Step-by-Step Example

**Solve:** 2x + 3 > 7

### Step 1: Identify the inequality
Symbol is **>** (greater than)

### Step 2: Subtract 3 from both sides
```
2x + 3 - 3 > 7 - 3
2x > 4
```

### Step 3: Divide both sides by 2
```
2x ÷ 2 > 4 ÷ 2
x > 2
```

### Step 4: Write the solution
```
x > 2
```
This means "x is any number greater than 2"

### Step 5: Check your answer
Try x = 3 (which is > 2):
```
2(3) + 3 > 7
6 + 3 > 7
9 > 7 ✓ TRUE
```

Try x = 1 (which is NOT > 2):
```
2(1) + 3 > 7
2 + 3 > 7
5 > 7 ✗ FALSE
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: The flip rule (dividing by negative)
**Solve:** -3x < 9

```
Divide both sides by -3:
-3x ÷ (-3) < 9 ÷ (-3)

FLIP THE SYMBOL when dividing by negative:
x > -3
```

**Why flip?** If -3x < 9, then x must be greater than -3 (not less than).

**Check:** Try x = 0 (which is > -3)
```
-3(0) < 9
0 < 9 ✓ TRUE
```

### Example 3: Multi-step inequality
**Solve:** 5x - 4 ≤ 11

```
Add 4 to both sides:
5x - 4 + 4 ≤ 11 + 4
5x ≤ 15

Divide by 5:
5x ÷ 5 ≤ 15 ÷ 5
x ≤ 3
```

**Solution:** x ≤ 3 (x can be 3 or any number less than 3)

**Check:** Try x = 2
```
5(2) - 4 ≤ 11
10 - 4 ≤ 11
6 ≤ 11 ✓
```

### Example 4: Variable on both sides
**Solve:** 4x + 5 > 2x + 13

```
Subtract 2x from both sides:
4x + 5 - 2x > 2x + 13 - 2x
2x + 5 > 13

Subtract 5 from both sides:
2x + 5 - 5 > 13 - 5
2x > 8

Divide by 2:
x > 4
```

**Check:** Try x = 5
```
4(5) + 5 > 2(5) + 13
20 + 5 > 10 + 13
25 > 23 ✓
```

## Graphing Solutions

**On a number line:**
- **Open circle** (○) for < or > (number not included)
- **Closed circle** (●) for ≤ or ≥ (number included)
- **Arrow** pointing to the solution region

Example: x > 2
```
<----○=========>
     2
```

Example: x ≤ -1
```
<========●------>
        -1
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Same as equations** - Most steps are identical
✓ **Flip when negative** - ONLY when multiplying/dividing by negative number
✓ **Range of solutions** - Answer is multiple values, not just one
✓ **Open vs closed circles** - Shows whether endpoint is included
✓ **Check makes sense** - Test values to verify solution region
✓ **Keep the direction** - Unless you multiply/divide by negative

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting to flip** - Wrong: -2x < 6 → x < -3
✓ Correct: -2x < 6 → x > -3

❌ **Flipping when not needed** - Wrong: x + 3 < 5 → x > 2
✓ Correct: x + 3 < 5 → x < 2 (only flip for multiply/divide by negative)

❌ **Wrong circle type** - Wrong: x ≤ 3 with open circle
✓ Correct: x ≤ 3 with closed circle (3 is included)

❌ **Arrow wrong direction** - Make sure arrow points to solution values
