# Slope-Intercept Form (y = mx + b)

## What is Slope-Intercept Form?

Slope-intercept form is the most common way to write a linear equation. It makes it easy to see the slope and y-intercept at a glance, which helps you graph the line quickly.

**Standard form:** y = mx + b

Where:
- **m** = slope (rate of change)
- **b** = y-intercept (where line crosses y-axis)
- **x** = independent variable
- **y** = dependent variable

Examples:
- y = 3x + 2 (slope = 3, y-intercept = 2)
- y = -x + 5 (slope = -1, y-intercept = 5)
- y = (1/2)x - 3 (slope = 1/2, y-intercept = -3)

## How to Use Slope-Intercept Form

Three main uses:

1. **Identify slope and y-intercept** - Read directly from equation
2. **Graph a line** - Plot y-intercept, use slope to find more points
3. **Write an equation** - Given slope and y-intercept

### Finding m and b:
1. Make sure equation is solved for y
2. Number multiplying x is the slope (m)
3. Constant term is the y-intercept (b)

## Step-by-Step Example

**Identify slope and y-intercept:** y = 4x - 3

### Step 1: Confirm it's in y = mx + b form
Yes, y is alone on left side ✓

### Step 2: Identify m (slope)
```
Coefficient of x = 4
Slope m = 4
```
This means: for every 1 unit right, go up 4 units

### Step 3: Identify b (y-intercept)
```
Constant term = -3
Y-intercept b = -3
```
This means: line crosses y-axis at (0, -3)

### Step 4: Graph the line
Plot (0, -3), then use slope 4/1:
```
Starting point: (0, -3)
Rise 4, run 1: (1, 1)
Rise 4, run 1: (2, 5)
```

### Check your answer
Test point (1, 1):
```
y = 4x - 3
1 = 4(1) - 3
1 = 4 - 3
1 = 1 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Writing equation from slope and y-intercept
**Write equation:** Slope = -2, y-intercept = 5

```
Use y = mx + b
m = -2
b = 5

Substitute:
y = -2x + 5
```

**Check:** At x = 1
```
y = -2(1) + 5 = -2 + 5 = 3
Point (1, 3) should be on the line ✓
```

### Example 3: Converting to slope-intercept form
**Convert:** 3x + y = 6

```
Solve for y (isolate y):
y = -3x + 6

Now in slope-intercept form:
m = -3 (slope)
b = 6 (y-intercept)
```

**Check:** At x = 0
```
y = -3(0) + 6 = 6
Y-intercept is (0, 6) ✓
```

### Example 4: Fractional slope
**Identify parts:** y = (2/3)x + 1

```
m = 2/3
- Rise = 2
- Run = 3
- Go up 2, right 3

b = 1
- Y-intercept at (0, 1)

Graph:
(0, 1) - start
(3, 3) - up 2, right 3
(6, 5) - up 2, right 3
```

**Check:** At (3, 3)
```
y = (2/3)(3) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 ✓
```

## Understanding Slope

**Positive slope:** Line goes up from left to right
- Example: y = 2x + 1

**Negative slope:** Line goes down from left to right
- Example: y = -2x + 1

**Zero slope:** Horizontal line
- Example: y = 3 (same as y = 0x + 3)

**Undefined slope:** Vertical line
- Example: x = 2 (cannot be written in y = mx + b form)

## Understanding Y-Intercept

**Positive b:** Line crosses y-axis above origin
- Example: y = 2x + 3 crosses at (0, 3)

**Negative b:** Line crosses y-axis below origin
- Example: y = 2x - 3 crosses at (0, -3)

**Zero b:** Line passes through origin
- Example: y = 2x (same as y = 2x + 0)

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **y must be alone** - Left side should be just y
✓ **m is the slope** - Coefficient of x tells steepness and direction
✓ **b is where it starts** - Y-intercept is the constant term
✓ **Slope is rise/run** - Vertical change over horizontal change
✓ **Can convert from other forms** - Solve for y to get slope-intercept
✓ **Quick to graph** - Start at b, use m to plot points

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Mixing up m and b** - Wrong: In y = 3x + 5, m = 5
✓ Correct: m = 3, b = 5

❌ **Forgetting negative signs** - Wrong: y = -2x + 3 has m = 2
✓ Correct: m = -2 (include the sign)

❌ **Not solving for y** - Wrong: x + y = 5 → m = 1, b = 5
✓ Correct: First solve for y → y = -x + 5 → m = -1, b = 5

❌ **Slope as run/rise** - Wrong: m = 3 means right 3, up 1
✓ Correct: m = 3 = 3/1 means up 3, right 1 (rise/run)
