# Point-Slope Form

## What is Point-Slope Form?

Point-slope form is a way to write the equation of a line when you know the slope and one point on the line. It's especially useful when you don't immediately know the y-intercept.

**Standard form:** y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)

Where:
- **m** = slope
- **(x₁, y₁)** = a specific point on the line
- **(x, y)** = any point on the line

Examples:
- y - 3 = 2(x - 1) [slope = 2, point = (1, 3)]
- y + 4 = -3(x - 2) [slope = -3, point = (2, -4)]
- y - 0 = (1/2)(x - 6) [slope = 1/2, point = (6, 0)]

## When to Use Point-Slope Form

Use this form when:
- You know the slope and one point
- You need to find equation from two points (find slope first)
- Converting to slope-intercept form
- Y-intercept is hard to find directly

## How to Write an Equation

Follow these steps:

1. **Identify the slope (m)** - Given or calculate from two points
2. **Identify a point (x₁, y₁)** - Choose one point on the line
3. **Substitute into formula** - Use y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
4. **Simplify if needed** - Can convert to slope-intercept form
5. **Check** - Verify the point satisfies the equation

## Step-by-Step Example

**Write equation:** Slope = 3, point = (2, 5)

### Step 1: Identify the parts
```
m = 3
(x₁, y₁) = (2, 5)
```

### Step 2: Substitute into point-slope form
```
y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
y - 5 = 3(x - 2)
```

### Step 3: This is the answer in point-slope form
```
y - 5 = 3(x - 2)
```

### Step 4: Convert to slope-intercept form (optional)
```
y - 5 = 3(x - 2)
y - 5 = 3x - 6
y = 3x - 6 + 5
y = 3x - 1
```

### Check your answer
Test point (2, 5):
```
Point-slope: 5 - 5 = 3(2 - 2) → 0 = 0 ✓
Slope-intercept: 5 = 3(2) - 1 → 5 = 5 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Finding equation from two points
**Write equation:** Line through (1, 4) and (3, 10)

```
Step 1: Find slope
m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)
m = (10 - 4)/(3 - 1)
m = 6/2 = 3

Step 2: Use either point (let's use (1, 4))
y - 4 = 3(x - 1)

Step 3: Simplify to slope-intercept form
y - 4 = 3x - 3
y = 3x + 1
```

**Check:** Both points work
```
(1, 4): y = 3(1) + 1 = 4 ✓
(3, 10): y = 3(3) + 1 = 10 ✓
```

### Example 3: Negative slope
**Write equation:** Slope = -2, point = (-1, 3)

```
y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
y - 3 = -2(x - (-1))
y - 3 = -2(x + 1)
y - 3 = -2x - 2
y = -2x + 1
```

**Check:** At (-1, 3)
```
3 = -2(-1) + 1
3 = 2 + 1
3 = 3 ✓
```

### Example 4: Horizontal line
**Write equation:** Slope = 0, point = (4, 7)

```
y - 7 = 0(x - 4)
y - 7 = 0
y = 7
```

This is a horizontal line at y = 7

**Check:** For ANY x value, y = 7 ✓

## Converting Between Forms

### Point-Slope to Slope-Intercept

**Given:** y - 2 = 4(x - 1)

```
Distribute:
y - 2 = 4x - 4

Add 2 to both sides:
y = 4x - 2

Now in y = mx + b form
```

### Slope-Intercept to Point-Slope

**Given:** y = 3x + 5

```
Pick any point on the line, say (0, 5)
Slope m = 3

Point-slope form:
y - 5 = 3(x - 0)
or
y - 5 = 3x
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Need slope and one point** - That's all you need
✓ **Any point works** - Use the point that makes math easier
✓ **Watch the signs** - y - y₁ and x - x₁ (subtraction)
✓ **Double negative** - y - (-3) becomes y + 3
✓ **Can convert forms** - Easily change to slope-intercept
✓ **Both forms equivalent** - Same line, different representation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong signs** - Wrong: y + 3 = 2(x - 1) when point is (1, 3)
✓ Correct: y - 3 = 2(x - 1)

❌ **Using slope as a point** - Wrong: y - 2 = 2(x - 2) when m=2, point=(3,8)
✓ Correct: y - 8 = 2(x - 3)

❌ **Switching x and y coordinates** - Wrong: Point (3,5) → y - 3 = m(x - 5)
✓ Correct: Point (3,5) → y - 5 = m(x - 3)

❌ **Forgetting to distribute** - Wrong: y - 1 = 2(x - 3) → y = 2x - 3
✓ Correct: y - 1 = 2(x - 3) → y - 1 = 2x - 6 → y = 2x - 5
