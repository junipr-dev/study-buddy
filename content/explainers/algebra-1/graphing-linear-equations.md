# Graphing Linear Equations

## What is Graphing a Linear Equation?

Graphing a linear equation means plotting all the points (x, y) that make the equation true on a coordinate plane. The result is always a straight line.

A linear equation typically looks like: y = mx + b or Ax + By = C

The graph shows the relationship between x and y values.

Examples:
- y = 2x + 1
- y = -x + 3
- 2x + y = 6

## How to Graph

Follow these steps to graph any linear equation:

1. **Solve for y** - Get equation in y = mx + b form (if not already)
2. **Find y-intercept** - Where line crosses y-axis (x = 0)
3. **Find slope** - Rate of change (rise over run)
4. **Plot starting point** - Put y-intercept on graph
5. **Use slope to find more points** - Rise/run from y-intercept
6. **Draw the line** - Connect points with straight edge
7. **Check** - Verify a point works in original equation

## Step-by-Step Example

**Graph:** y = 2x + 1

### Step 1: Identify the parts
Equation is already in y = mx + b form:
- Slope (m) = 2
- Y-intercept (b) = 1

### Step 2: Plot the y-intercept
Y-intercept is 1, so plot point (0, 1)
```
Point: (0, 1)
```

### Step 3: Use the slope
Slope = 2 = 2/1 means:
- Rise = 2 (go up 2)
- Run = 1 (go right 1)

### Step 4: Plot second point
From (0, 1):
- Go up 2, right 1
- New point: (1, 3)
```
Point: (1, 3)
```

### Step 5: Plot third point (optional but helpful)
From (1, 3):
- Go up 2, right 1
- New point: (2, 5)

### Step 6: Draw the line
Connect the points with a straight line extending in both directions

### Step 7: Check your answer
Test point (1, 3) in original equation:
```
y = 2x + 1
3 = 2(1) + 1
3 = 2 + 1
3 = 3 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Negative slope
**Graph:** y = -x + 3

```
Y-intercept: (0, 3)
Slope: -1 = -1/1 (down 1, right 1)

Points:
(0, 3) - y-intercept
(1, 2) - from (0,3): down 1, right 1
(2, 1) - from (1,2): down 1, right 1

Draw line through these points
```

**Check:** At (1, 2): y = -(1) + 3 = 2 ✓

### Example 3: Using a table of values
**Graph:** 2x + y = 6

```
First, solve for y:
y = -2x + 6

Or make a table:
x  |  y
---|---
0  |  6   (when x=0: y=6)
1  |  4   (when x=1: 2(1)+y=6, so y=4)
2  |  2   (when x=2: 2(2)+y=6, so y=2)
3  |  0   (when x=3: 2(3)+y=6, so y=0)

Plot these points and connect
```

**Check:** At (1, 4): 2(1) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6 ✓

### Example 4: Fractional slope
**Graph:** y = (1/2)x + 2

```
Y-intercept: (0, 2)
Slope: 1/2 (up 1, right 2)

Points:
(0, 2) - y-intercept
(2, 3) - from (0,2): up 1, right 2
(4, 4) - from (2,3): up 1, right 2

Or go backwards: down 1, left 2
(-2, 1) - from (0,2): down 1, left 2
```

**Check:** At (2, 3): y = (1/2)(2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Two points make a line** - But three is better for accuracy
✓ **Slope tells direction** - Positive = up-right, negative = down-right
✓ **Y-intercept is easiest first point** - Where x = 0
✓ **Rise over run** - Slope = rise/run = vertical/horizontal
✓ **Extend the line** - Use arrows to show it continues
✓ **Label your axes** - Mark x and y with numbers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Plotting points incorrectly** - Wrong: (3, 2) means x=2, y=3
✓ Correct: (3, 2) means x=3, y=2 (x always first)

❌ **Wrong slope direction** - Wrong: Negative slope going up
✓ Correct: Negative slope always goes down-right

❌ **Not extending line** - Lines go infinitely in both directions
✓ Correct: Use arrows and extend beyond plotted points

❌ **Curved lines** - Wrong: Connecting points with a curve
✓ Correct: LINEAR means straight line with straight edge
