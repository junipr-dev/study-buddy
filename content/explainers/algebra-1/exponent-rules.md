# Laws of Exponents

## What are Exponents?

An exponent tells you how many times to multiply a number by itself. The exponent (or power) is written as a small number to the upper right of the base.

**Notation:** a^n where:
- **a** = base (the number being multiplied)
- **n** = exponent (how many times to multiply)

Examples:
- 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8
- 5² = 5 × 5 = 25
- x⁴ = x × x × x × x

## The Laws of Exponents

There are several rules that make working with exponents easier:

### 1. Product Rule: Multiply with Same Base
**When multiplying, ADD the exponents:**
```
a^m × a^n = a^(m+n)
```

Example: x³ × x⁵ = x^(3+5) = x⁸

### 2. Quotient Rule: Divide with Same Base
**When dividing, SUBTRACT the exponents:**
```
a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)
```

Example: x⁷ ÷ x³ = x^(7-3) = x⁴

### 3. Power Rule: Power to a Power
**Multiply the exponents:**
```
(a^m)^n = a^(m×n)
```

Example: (x²)³ = x^(2×3) = x⁶

### 4. Product to a Power
**Distribute the exponent:**
```
(ab)^n = a^n × b^n
```

Example: (2x)³ = 2³ × x³ = 8x³

### 5. Quotient to a Power
**Distribute the exponent:**
```
(a/b)^n = a^n / b^n
```

Example: (x/3)² = x²/3² = x²/9

## Special Exponent Rules

### Zero Exponent
**Any non-zero number to the zero power is 1:**
```
a^0 = 1 (where a ≠ 0)
```

Examples:
- 5^0 = 1
- x^0 = 1
- (2xy)^0 = 1

### Negative Exponent
**Negative exponent means reciprocal:**
```
a^(-n) = 1/a^n
```

Examples:
- 2^(-3) = 1/2³ = 1/8
- x^(-2) = 1/x²
- 5x^(-1) = 5/x

## Step-by-Step Examples

### Example 1: Product rule
**Simplify:** x⁴ × x³

```
Same base (x), so add exponents:
x⁴ × x³ = x^(4+3) = x⁷
```

**Check with numbers:** Let x = 2
```
2⁴ × 2³ = 16 × 8 = 128
2⁷ = 128 ✓
```

### Example 2: Quotient rule
**Simplify:** y⁸ ÷ y⁵

```
Same base (y), so subtract exponents:
y⁸ ÷ y⁵ = y^(8-5) = y³
```

**Check with numbers:** Let y = 2
```
2⁸ ÷ 2⁵ = 256 ÷ 32 = 8
2³ = 8 ✓
```

### Example 3: Power rule
**Simplify:** (x³)⁴

```
Power to a power, multiply exponents:
(x³)⁴ = x^(3×4) = x¹²
```

**Check with numbers:** Let x = 2
```
(2³)⁴ = 8⁴ = 4,096
2¹² = 4,096 ✓
```

### Example 4: Multiple rules combined
**Simplify:** (2x²y³)³

```
Distribute exponent to each factor:
(2x²y³)³ = 2³ × (x²)³ × (y³)³

Simplify each part:
= 8 × x⁶ × y⁹
= 8x⁶y⁹
```

**Verify:** Let x = 1, y = 1
```
(2·1²·1³)³ = 2³ = 8
8·1⁶·1⁹ = 8 ✓
```

### Example 5: Negative exponents
**Simplify:** x⁵ ÷ x⁸

```
Subtract exponents:
x⁵ ÷ x⁸ = x^(5-8) = x^(-3)

Convert to positive exponent:
x^(-3) = 1/x³
```

**Check with numbers:** Let x = 2
```
2⁵ ÷ 2⁸ = 32 ÷ 256 = 1/8
1/2³ = 1/8 ✓
```

### Example 6: Zero exponent
**Simplify:** (3x²y)⁰

```
Anything to the zero power is 1:
(3x²y)⁰ = 1
```

Even though 3, x², and y are different, the entire expression raised to 0 equals 1.

## Complex Example

**Simplify:** (2x³y²)² × (x²y)³ ÷ (xy)⁴

```
Step 1: Expand each part
(2x³y²)² = 4x⁶y⁴
(x²y)³ = x⁶y³
(xy)⁴ = x⁴y⁴

Step 2: Multiply first two
4x⁶y⁴ × x⁶y³ = 4x¹²y⁷

Step 3: Divide by third
4x¹²y⁷ ÷ x⁴y⁴ = 4x⁸y³

Answer: 4x⁸y³
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Same base required** - Can only add/subtract exponents with same base
✓ **Add when multiplying** - a^m × a^n = a^(m+n)
✓ **Subtract when dividing** - a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)
✓ **Multiply when power to power** - (a^m)^n = a^(mn)
✓ **Zero power is 1** - Anything (except 0) to the zero is 1
✓ **Negative means reciprocal** - a^(-n) = 1/a^n

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Multiplying exponents when multiplying bases** - Wrong: x² × x³ = x⁶
✓ Correct: x² × x³ = x⁵ (add exponents)

❌ **Adding exponents to coefficient** - Wrong: (2x³)² = 4x⁵
✓ Correct: (2x³)² = 4x⁶

❌ **Distributing exponents to sums** - Wrong: (x + y)² = x² + y²
✓ Correct: (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y² (must FOIL)

❌ **Confusing negative base and exponent** - Wrong: -2³ = (-2)³
✓ Correct: -2³ = -(2³) = -8, but (-2)³ = -8, (-2)² = 4
