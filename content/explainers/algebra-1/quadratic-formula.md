# The Quadratic Formula

## What is the Quadratic Formula?

The quadratic formula is a powerful tool that solves ANY quadratic equation, even when factoring is difficult or impossible. It gives you the solutions directly by plugging numbers into a formula.

**For the equation:** ax² + bx + c = 0

**The formula is:**
```
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)
```

This works for all quadratic equations where a ≠ 0.

## Understanding the Parts

- **a** = coefficient of x²
- **b** = coefficient of x
- **c** = constant term
- **±** = plus-or-minus (gives two solutions)
- **b² - 4ac** = discriminant (tells you about solutions)

## How to Use the Formula

Follow these steps:

1. **Write in standard form** - ax² + bx + c = 0
2. **Identify a, b, c** - Note the signs!
3. **Substitute into formula** - Plug values carefully
4. **Simplify under square root** - Calculate b² - 4ac
5. **Calculate both solutions** - Use + and - versions
6. **Check** - Verify at least one solution

## Step-by-Step Example

**Solve:** x² + 5x + 6 = 0

### Step 1: Already in standard form
```
x² + 5x + 6 = 0
```

### Step 2: Identify a, b, c
```
a = 1 (coefficient of x²)
b = 5 (coefficient of x)
c = 6 (constant)
```

### Step 3: Write the formula
```
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)
```

### Step 4: Substitute values
```
x = [-(5) ± √((5)² - 4(1)(6))] / (2(1))
x = [-5 ± √(25 - 24)] / 2
x = [-5 ± √1] / 2
x = [-5 ± 1] / 2
```

### Step 5: Calculate both solutions
Using +:
```
x = (-5 + 1) / 2 = -4/2 = -2
```

Using -:
```
x = (-5 - 1) / 2 = -6/2 = -3
```

### Step 6: Solutions are x = -2 and x = -3

### Check x = -2:
```
(-2)² + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: No rational solutions
**Solve:** x² + 3x + 1 = 0

```
a = 1, b = 3, c = 1

x = [-3 ± √(9 - 4)] / 2
x = [-3 ± √5] / 2

Two solutions (decimal approximations):
x = (-3 + √5) / 2 ≈ -0.38
x = (-3 - √5) / 2 ≈ -2.62
```

**Check for x ≈ -0.38:**
```
(-0.38)² + 3(-0.38) + 1 ≈ 0.14 - 1.14 + 1 ≈ 0 ✓
```

### Example 3: Negative coefficient a
**Solve:** -2x² + 4x + 6 = 0

```
a = -2, b = 4, c = 6

x = [-4 ± √(16 - 4(-2)(6))] / (2(-2))
x = [-4 ± √(16 + 48)] / (-4)
x = [-4 ± √64] / (-4)
x = [-4 ± 8] / (-4)

Using +:
x = (-4 + 8) / (-4) = 4/(-4) = -1

Using -:
x = (-4 - 8) / (-4) = -12/(-4) = 3
```

**Check x = 3:**
```
-2(3)² + 4(3) + 6 = -18 + 12 + 6 = 0 ✓
```

### Example 4: One solution (perfect square)
**Solve:** x² - 6x + 9 = 0

```
a = 1, b = -6, c = 9

x = [6 ± √(36 - 36)] / 2
x = [6 ± √0] / 2
x = [6 ± 0] / 2
x = 6/2 = 3

Only one solution: x = 3 (repeated root)
```

This is because (x - 3)² = 0

## The Discriminant (b² - 4ac)

The value under the square root tells you about solutions:

**b² - 4ac > 0:** Two different real solutions
```
Example: x² + x - 2 = 0
1² - 4(1)(-2) = 1 + 8 = 9 > 0 ✓
```

**b² - 4ac = 0:** One repeated real solution
```
Example: x² - 4x + 4 = 0
(-4)² - 4(1)(4) = 16 - 16 = 0 ✓
```

**b² - 4ac < 0:** No real solutions (complex)
```
Example: x² + x + 1 = 0
1² - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0
Cannot take square root of negative (in real numbers)
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Works for ALL quadratics** - Even when factoring fails
✓ **Include the signs** - Watch negative values for a, b, c
✓ **Two solutions usually** - Plus-or-minus gives two answers
✓ **Discriminant predicts** - Check b² - 4ac before solving
✓ **Simplify radicals** - √4 = 2, not ±2 (± is already in formula)
✓ **Keep fractions separate** - Don't split numerator and denominator

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting negative** - Wrong: -b when b is already negative
✓ Correct: -b means -(-5) = +5 when b = -5

❌ **Wrong order of operations** - Wrong: -b + √... / 2a
✓ Correct: [-b + √...] / (2a) - divide entire numerator

❌ **Sign of b** - Wrong: For x² - 5x + 6, using b = 5
✓ Correct: b = -5 (include the negative sign)

❌ **Splitting the fraction** - Wrong: (-4 + 2)/6 = -4/6 + 2/6
✓ Correct: (-4 + 2)/6 = -2/6 = -1/3 (add first, then divide)
