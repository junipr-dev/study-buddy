# Complex Numbers

## What are Complex Numbers?

A complex number is a number that contains both a real part and an imaginary part. Imaginary numbers use the symbol **i**, which represents the square root of -1 (i² = -1).

Complex numbers allow us to solve equations that have no real solutions, like x² + 1 = 0. They're used in electrical engineering, physics, and signal processing.

**General form:** a + bi

Where:
- a is the real part
- b is the imaginary part
- i is the imaginary unit (√-1)

Examples:
- 3 + 4i
- -2 + 5i
- 6 - 2i
- 5i (purely imaginary, a = 0)
- 7 (purely real, b = 0)

## How to Work with Complex Numbers

Operations with complex numbers follow algebra rules with one key fact: **i² = -1**

### Addition and Subtraction
1. **Combine like terms** - Add/subtract real parts and imaginary parts separately
2. **Keep i with imaginary terms** - Don't try to combine real and imaginary parts

### Multiplication
1. **Use FOIL or distributive property** - Multiply like binomials
2. **Simplify i²** - Replace any i² with -1
3. **Combine like terms** - Collect real and imaginary parts

### Division
1. **Multiply by conjugate** - The conjugate of a + bi is a - bi
2. **Simplify** - The denominator becomes a real number
3. **Separate parts** - Write in a + bi form

## Step-by-Step Example

**Add:** (3 + 4i) + (2 - 5i)

### Step 1: Group real and imaginary parts
Separate the real parts (3 and 2) from the imaginary parts (4i and -5i):
```
(3 + 2) + (4i - 5i)
```

### Step 2: Combine like terms
Add the real parts together, and the imaginary parts together:
```
5 + (-1i)
5 - i
```

### Step 3: Write in standard form
The answer is already in a + bi form:
```
5 - i
```

### Step 4: Check your answer
Verify by adding the original numbers:
```
3 + 4i
+ 2 - 5i
-------
5 - i ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Multiplication
**Multiply:** (2 + 3i)(1 + 4i)

```
Use FOIL:
First: 2 × 1 = 2
Outer: 2 × 4i = 8i
Inner: 3i × 1 = 3i
Last: 3i × 4i = 12i²

Combine: 2 + 8i + 3i + 12i²
Simplify i² = -1: 2 + 11i + 12(-1)
2 + 11i - 12
-10 + 11i
```

**Check:** The answer has both real (-10) and imaginary (11i) parts ✓

### Example 3: Division
**Divide:** (6 + 8i) ÷ (1 + i)

```
Multiply by conjugate (1 - i):
(6 + 8i)(1 - i)
─────────────
(1 + i)(1 - i)

Numerator: 6 - 6i + 8i - 8i² = 6 + 2i - 8(-1) = 6 + 2i + 8 = 14 + 2i
Denominator: 1 - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2

Result: (14 + 2i)/2 = 7 + i
```

**Check:** (7 + i)(1 + i) = 7 + 7i + i + i² = 7 + 8i - 1 = 6 + 8i ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **i² = -1** - This is the fundamental property of imaginary numbers
✓ **Real and imaginary parts stay separate** - You can't combine them like regular terms
✓ **Standard form is a + bi** - Real part first, then imaginary part
✓ **Use conjugates for division** - Multiply top and bottom by the conjugate
✓ **Complex numbers follow algebra rules** - Add, subtract, multiply, and factor normally
✓ **Powers of i cycle** - i¹ = i, i² = -1, i³ = -i, i⁴ = 1, then repeat

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting to simplify i²** - Always replace i² with -1
❌ **Combining real and imaginary parts** - Keep them separate
❌ **Wrong conjugate** - Conjugate of a + bi is a - bi (flip only the sign of i)
❌ **Not simplifying fully** - Make sure your answer is in a + bi form
