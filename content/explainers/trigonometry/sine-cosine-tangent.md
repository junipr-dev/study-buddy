# Sine, Cosine, and Tangent

## What are Sine, Cosine, and Tangent?

Sine, cosine, and tangent are the three fundamental trigonometric functions. They relate the angles of a right triangle to the ratios of its sides.

**In a right triangle:**
- **Sine (sin)** - Opposite side ÷ Hypotenuse
- **Cosine (cos)** - Adjacent side ÷ Hypotenuse
- **Tangent (tan)** - Opposite side ÷ Adjacent side

**Memory trick: SOH-CAH-TOA**
- **S**ine = **O**pposite/**H**ypotenuse
- **C**osine = **A**djacent/**H**ypotenuse
- **T**angent = **O**pposite/**A**djacent

**On the unit circle:**
- sin(θ) = y-coordinate
- cos(θ) = x-coordinate
- tan(θ) = y/x = sin(θ)/cos(θ)

Examples:
- sin(30°) = 1/2
- cos(60°) = 1/2
- tan(45°) = 1

## How to Use Trig Functions

### Finding a side
1. **Label the triangle** - Mark opposite, adjacent, hypotenuse relative to the angle
2. **Choose the right function** - Based on which sides you know/need
3. **Set up the equation** - Function = side ratio
4. **Solve for unknown** - Use algebra

### Finding an angle
1. **Calculate the ratio** - Divide the known sides
2. **Use inverse function** - sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, or tan⁻¹
3. **Get the angle** - Use calculator

## Step-by-Step Example

**Find x:** In a right triangle, the angle is 30°, the hypotenuse is 10, and x is the opposite side.

### Step 1: Identify what you have
Angle = 30°, hypotenuse = 10, opposite = x (unknown)
```
Need to find: opposite side
Have: angle and hypotenuse
```

### Step 2: Choose the trig function
Since we have opposite and hypotenuse, use sine:
```
sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse
```

### Step 3: Set up the equation
Substitute the known values:
```
sin(30°) = x/10
```

### Step 4: Solve for x
Multiply both sides by 10:
```
10 · sin(30°) = x
10 · (1/2) = x
5 = x
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
Verify the ratio: 5/10 = 1/2 = sin(30°)
```
x = 5 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Using cosine
**Find x:** Right triangle, angle = 60°, hypotenuse = 8, x is adjacent

```
cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse
cos(60°) = x/8
8 · cos(60°) = x
8 · (1/2) = x
x = 4
```

**Check:** 4/8 = 1/2 = cos(60°) ✓

### Example 3: Using tangent
**Find x:** Right triangle, angle = 45°, opposite = 6, x is adjacent

```
tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent
tan(45°) = 6/x
1 = 6/x        (tan(45°) = 1)
x = 6
```

**Check:** 6/6 = 1 = tan(45°) ✓

### Example 4: Finding an angle
**Find θ:** Right triangle, opposite = 3, adjacent = 4

```
tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent
tan(θ) = 3/4
tan(θ) = 0.75
θ = tan⁻¹(0.75)
θ ≈ 36.87°
```

**Check:** tan(36.87°) ≈ 0.75 ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **SOH-CAH-TOA** - Essential memory tool for ratios
✓ **Hypotenuse is always longest** - It's opposite the right angle
✓ **Opposite and adjacent are relative** - They depend on which angle you're using
✓ **Use inverse functions for angles** - sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹ (also written as arcsin, arccos, arctan)
✓ **Calculator modes matter** - Make sure you're in degree or radian mode
✓ **Tangent is sine/cosine** - tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ)
✓ **Range matters** - Sine and cosine are between -1 and 1, tangent can be any value
✓ **Special angles** - Memorize sin, cos, tan for 30°, 45°, 60°

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Wrong side labels** - Make sure opposite/adjacent are relative to the angle you're using
❌ **Using wrong function** - Match your known sides to SOH-CAH-TOA
❌ **Forgetting calculator mode** - Degrees vs radians give different answers
❌ **Mixing up inverse** - sin⁻¹ finds an angle, sin finds a ratio
