# Graphing Trigonometric Functions

## What are Trig Function Graphs?

The graphs of sine, cosine, and tangent functions show how these functions behave as the angle changes. Understanding these graphs helps visualize periodic behavior seen in waves, oscillations, and circular motion.

**Key features of trig graphs:**

**Sine and Cosine:**
- **Amplitude** - Height of the wave (distance from center to peak)
- **Period** - Length of one complete cycle
- **Midline** - Horizontal line through the center
- **Phase shift** - Horizontal translation

**Tangent:**
- **Period** - Length before the pattern repeats
- **Asymptotes** - Vertical lines where the function is undefined

**Standard periods:**
- sin(x) and cos(x): 2π (or 360°)
- tan(x): π (or 180°)

## General Forms

**Sine/Cosine:** y = A·sin(B(x - C)) + D or y = A·cos(B(x - C)) + D
- A = amplitude (vertical stretch)
- B affects period: Period = 2π/B
- C = phase shift (horizontal shift)
- D = vertical shift (midline)

**Tangent:** y = A·tan(B(x - C)) + D
- Period = π/B
- Asymptotes at x = π/(2B) + πn/B

## Step-by-Step Example

**Graph:** y = 2sin(x) from 0 to 2π

### Step 1: Identify key values
Amplitude A = 2, period = 2π, midline at y = 0
```
Maximum: y = 2
Minimum: y = -2
Period: 2π
```

### Step 2: Mark key points
Plot five key points per period:
```
x = 0: y = 2sin(0) = 0 (start)
x = π/2: y = 2sin(π/2) = 2 (max)
x = π: y = 2sin(π) = 0 (middle)
x = 3π/2: y = 2sin(3π/2) = -2 (min)
x = 2π: y = 2sin(2π) = 0 (end)
```

### Step 3: Plot the points
Mark the five points on the coordinate plane:
```
(0, 0), (π/2, 2), (π, 0), (3π/2, -2), (2π, 0)
```

### Step 4: Draw the curve
Connect points with a smooth wave:
```
Start at origin, rise to peak, return to midline,
fall to trough, return to end
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
Verify the amplitude and period:
```
Amplitude: Distance from 0 to 2 = 2 ✓
Period: Distance from 0 to 2π = 2π ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Cosine with amplitude
**Graph:** y = 3cos(x)

```
Key differences from sine:
- Starts at maximum (3) instead of 0
- Same period (2π), amplitude (3)

Key points:
x = 0: y = 3 (start at max)
x = π/2: y = 0 (crosses midline)
x = π: y = -3 (minimum)
x = 3π/2: y = 0 (crosses midline)
x = 2π: y = 3 (back to max)
```

**Check:** cos(0) = 1, so 3·cos(0) = 3 ✓

### Example 3: Period change
**Graph:** y = sin(2x)

```
B = 2, so period = 2π/2 = π

Key points (compressed horizontally):
x = 0: y = 0
x = π/4: y = 1 (max comes sooner)
x = π/2: y = 0
x = 3π/4: y = -1 (min comes sooner)
x = π: y = 0 (complete cycle)
```

**Check:** One complete wave from 0 to π (half the normal period) ✓

### Example 4: Vertical shift
**Graph:** y = sin(x) + 1

```
D = 1, so midline shifts up to y = 1

Key points:
x = 0: y = 1 (midline, not 0)
x = π/2: y = 2 (max, was 1)
x = π: y = 1 (midline)
x = 3π/2: y = 0 (min, was -1)
x = 2π: y = 1 (back to midline)
```

**Check:** Range is now [0, 2] instead of [-1, 1] ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Sine starts at midline** - Goes up first (at 0)
✓ **Cosine starts at maximum** - Goes down first (at 0)
✓ **Tangent has asymptotes** - Undefined where cosine = 0
✓ **Amplitude only for sin/cos** - Tangent has no amplitude (unbounded)
✓ **Period tells you cycle length** - How far until the pattern repeats
✓ **Five key points per cycle** - Start, max, middle, min, end
✓ **B affects frequency** - Larger B = more cycles, shorter period
✓ **Negative A flips the graph** - Reflects over the midline

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Confusing amplitude and period** - A affects height, B affects width
❌ **Wrong period formula** - For tan it's π/B, for sin/cos it's 2π/B
❌ **Starting sine at max** - Sine starts at midline, cosine starts at max
❌ **Forgetting asymptotes for tangent** - Mark vertical asymptotes first
