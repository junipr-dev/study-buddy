# Pythagorean Identities

## What are Pythagorean Identities?

Pythagorean identities are fundamental equations in trigonometry that relate sine, cosine, and tangent functions. They're called "Pythagorean" because they come from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the unit circle.

**The three main identities:**

1. **sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1** (most important)
2. **1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ)**
3. **1 + cot²(θ) = csc²(θ)**

These identities are always true for any angle θ. They're used to simplify trig expressions, prove other identities, and solve equations.

**Where they come from:**
On the unit circle, any point (x, y) satisfies x² + y² = 1 (Pythagorean theorem with radius 1). Since x = cos(θ) and y = sin(θ), we get sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1.

## How to Use Pythagorean Identities

### Simplifying expressions
1. **Identify the pattern** - Look for sin² + cos², 1 + tan², or 1 + cot²
2. **Substitute the identity** - Replace with the equivalent form
3. **Simplify** - Combine and reduce terms

### Solving for one function from another
1. **Use the first identity** - sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
2. **Isolate what you need** - Solve for the unknown function
3. **Take the square root** - Remember ± sign
4. **Check the quadrant** - Determine the correct sign

## Step-by-Step Example

**Simplify:** sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) + tan²(θ)

### Step 1: Identify the Pythagorean identity
Recognize sin²(θ) + cos²(θ):
```
sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
```

### Step 2: Substitute
Replace sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) with 1:
```
sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) + tan²(θ)
= 1 + tan²(θ)
```

### Step 3: Apply another identity
Recognize 1 + tan²(θ):
```
1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ)
```

### Step 4: Write the final answer
```
sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ)
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
Pick a test angle, like θ = 45°:
```
sin²(45°) + cos²(45°) + tan²(45°)
= (√2/2)² + (√2/2)² + 1²
= 1/2 + 1/2 + 1
= 2
= sec²(45°) = (√2)² = 2 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Find cos(θ) from sin(θ)
**Given:** sin(θ) = 3/5, θ is in quadrant I. Find cos(θ).

```
Use identity: sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
(3/5)² + cos²(θ) = 1
9/25 + cos²(θ) = 1
cos²(θ) = 1 - 9/25
cos²(θ) = 16/25
cos(θ) = ±4/5

Since θ is in quadrant I, cos(θ) is positive:
cos(θ) = 4/5
```

**Check:** (3/5)² + (4/5)² = 9/25 + 16/25 = 25/25 = 1 ✓

### Example 3: Simplify using identities
**Simplify:** sec²(θ) - tan²(θ)

```
Use identity: 1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ)
Rearrange: sec²(θ) - tan²(θ) = 1

Answer: 1
```

**Check:** For any angle, sec²(θ) - tan²(θ) = 1 (this is the identity rearranged) ✓

### Example 4: Prove an identity
**Prove:** sin²(θ) = 1 - cos²(θ)

```
Start with: sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
Subtract cos²(θ) from both sides:
sin²(θ) = 1 - cos²(θ) ✓
```

**Check:** This is the first identity rearranged ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 is fundamental** - Memorize this one first
✓ **Always true for any angle** - These are identities, not equations to solve
✓ **Notation: sin²(θ) means (sin(θ))²** - The exponent applies to the entire function
✓ **Other identities derived from the first** - Divide by cos²(θ) or sin²(θ)
✓ **Used for simplification** - Look for opportunities to substitute
✓ **Watch the signs** - When taking square roots, consider the quadrant
✓ **Rearrange as needed** - cos²(θ) = 1 - sin²(θ) is the same identity

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Confusing sin²(θ) with sin(θ²)** - The exponent is on the function value, not the angle
❌ **Forgetting the ± when solving** - Square roots have two solutions
❌ **Wrong quadrant sign** - Check which quadrant to determine positive or negative
❌ **Not recognizing patterns** - Practice spotting sin² + cos² in expressions
