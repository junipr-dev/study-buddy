# Inverse Trigonometric Functions

## What are Inverse Trig Functions?

Inverse trigonometric functions (also called arc functions) do the opposite of regular trig functions. While sin(θ) gives you a ratio from an angle, sin⁻¹(ratio) gives you the angle from a ratio.

**The three main inverse functions:**
- **sin⁻¹(x)** or **arcsin(x)** - "What angle has sine equal to x?"
- **cos⁻¹(x)** or **arccos(x)** - "What angle has cosine equal to x?"
- **tan⁻¹(x)** or **arctan(x)** - "What angle has tangent equal to x?"

**Important:** The notation sin⁻¹ does NOT mean 1/sin. It means the inverse function.

**Domains and ranges:**
- sin⁻¹(x): input [-1, 1], output [-π/2, π/2] or [-90°, 90°]
- cos⁻¹(x): input [-1, 1], output [0, π] or [0°, 180°]
- tan⁻¹(x): input all real numbers, output (-π/2, π/2) or (-90°, 90°)

Examples:
- sin⁻¹(1/2) = 30° or π/6
- cos⁻¹(0) = 90° or π/2
- tan⁻¹(1) = 45° or π/4

## How to Use Inverse Trig Functions

### Finding angles from ratios
1. **Calculate the ratio** - From the given sides
2. **Choose the inverse function** - Match to what ratio you have
3. **Apply the function** - Use calculator or special angles
4. **Check units** - Degrees or radians

### Solving equations
1. **Isolate the trig function** - Get sin(θ), cos(θ), or tan(θ) alone
2. **Apply inverse function** - To both sides
3. **Find all solutions** - Remember trig functions repeat
4. **Check the domain** - Make sure solutions are valid

## Step-by-Step Example

**Find the angle:** sin(θ) = √3/2

### Step 1: Apply the inverse function
Take sin⁻¹ of both sides:
```
sin⁻¹(sin(θ)) = sin⁻¹(√3/2)
θ = sin⁻¹(√3/2)
```

### Step 2: Evaluate using special angles
Recognize √3/2 is a special value:
```
sin(60°) = √3/2
sin(π/3) = √3/2
```

### Step 3: State the principal value
The inverse gives the principal value:
```
θ = 60° or π/3 radians
```

### Step 4: Find other solutions (if needed)
Sine is also positive in quadrant II:
```
180° - 60° = 120° (another solution)
π - π/3 = 2π/3 (in radians)
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
Verify: sin(60°) = √3/2 ✓ and sin(120°) = √3/2 ✓
```
Both angles have the same sine value ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Cosine inverse
**Find θ:** cos(θ) = -1/2, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π

```
θ = cos⁻¹(-1/2)

cos(120°) = cos(2π/3) = -1/2
θ = 120° or 2π/3 radians
```

**Check:** cos(120°) = -1/2 ✓ and 120° is in [0°, 180°] ✓

### Example 3: Tangent inverse
**Find θ:** tan(θ) = √3

```
θ = tan⁻¹(√3)

tan(60°) = tan(π/3) = √3
θ = 60° or π/3 radians
```

**Check:** tan(60°) = √3 ✓

### Example 4: Calculator computation
**Evaluate:** sin⁻¹(0.7)

```
Use calculator (in degree mode):
sin⁻¹(0.7) ≈ 44.43°

Or in radian mode:
sin⁻¹(0.7) ≈ 0.775 radians
```

**Check:** sin(44.43°) ≈ 0.7 ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Inverse functions "undo" regular functions** - sin⁻¹(sin(x)) = x (with restrictions)
✓ **Domain restrictions are important** - Inverse functions only give principal values
✓ **Output ranges are restricted** - Each inverse has a specific output range
✓ **sin⁻¹ means arcsin** - Not 1/sin (that's csc)
✓ **Multiple solutions exist** - Trig equations often have infinitely many solutions
✓ **Principal value is the standard** - The one in the defined range
✓ **Calculator modes matter** - Degree vs radian affects the answer
✓ **Special angles are key** - Memorize inverse values for 30°, 45°, 60°

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Confusing sin⁻¹ with 1/sin** - They are completely different
❌ **Forgetting other solutions** - Principal value isn't always the only answer
❌ **Domain errors** - Can't take sin⁻¹(2) (must be between -1 and 1)
❌ **Wrong calculator mode** - Check degrees vs radians
