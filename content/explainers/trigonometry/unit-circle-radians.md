# Unit Circle and Radians

## What is the Unit Circle?

The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate plane. It's the foundation for understanding trigonometry because it connects angles to coordinates.

**Why "unit"?** The radius is exactly 1 unit, which simplifies calculations.

**Radians** are a way to measure angles based on the radius of a circle. One radian is the angle created when the arc length equals the radius.

**Key conversions:**
- Full circle: 360° = 2π radians
- Half circle: 180° = π radians
- Quarter circle: 90° = π/2 radians
- 1 radian ≈ 57.3°

Examples:
- 45° = π/4 radians
- 60° = π/3 radians
- 30° = π/6 radians
- 270° = 3π/2 radians

## How to Convert Between Degrees and Radians

### Degrees to Radians
1. **Multiply by π/180** - Conversion factor
2. **Simplify** - Reduce the fraction if possible

### Radians to Degrees
1. **Multiply by 180/π** - Inverse conversion factor
2. **Simplify** - Calculate the result

### Reading the Unit Circle
1. **Start at (1, 0)** - This is 0° or 0 radians
2. **Move counterclockwise** - Positive angles
3. **Read coordinates** - x-coordinate is cosine, y-coordinate is sine
4. **Key angles** - Memorize special angles (multiples of 30° and 45°)

## Step-by-Step Example

**Convert 60° to radians:**

### Step 1: Set up the conversion
Use the conversion factor π/180:
```
60° × (π/180)
```

### Step 2: Multiply
Multiply 60 by the fraction:
```
(60 × π)/180
60π/180
```

### Step 3: Simplify the fraction
Divide both numerator and denominator by their GCD (60):
```
60π/180 = π/3
```

### Step 4: Write the answer
```
60° = π/3 radians
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
Verify using the inverse: (π/3) × (180/π) = 180/3 = 60°
```
π/3 radians = 60° ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Radians to degrees
**Convert 3π/4 radians to degrees:**

```
(3π/4) × (180/π)
= (3π × 180)/(4π)
= (3 × 180)/4
= 540/4
= 135°
```

**Check:** 135° × (π/180) = 135π/180 = 3π/4 ✓

### Example 3: Find coordinates on unit circle
**What are the coordinates at π/4 radians (45°)?**

```
At 45°, the angle makes an isosceles right triangle
with the axes.

x-coordinate (cosine): √2/2 ≈ 0.707
y-coordinate (sine): √2/2 ≈ 0.707

Point: (√2/2, √2/2)
```

**Check:** (√2/2)² + (√2/2)² = 2/4 + 2/4 = 4/4 = 1 (radius = 1) ✓

### Example 4: Common angle conversion
**Convert 270° to radians:**

```
270° × (π/180)
= 270π/180
= 3π/2 radians
```

**Check:** This is 3/4 of a full circle: (3/4) × 2π = 3π/2 ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Radians are arc length** - The angle where arc = radius
✓ **π radians = 180°** - This is the fundamental conversion
✓ **Counterclockwise is positive** - Standard direction for measuring angles
✓ **Unit circle coordinates** - (cos θ, sin θ) for any angle θ
✓ **Special angles** - Memorize π/6, π/4, π/3, and their multiples
✓ **Full circle is 2π** - Not 360 in radians
✓ **Radius is 1** - Makes calculations easier
✓ **Radians are unitless** - They're a ratio (arc/radius)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Using wrong conversion** - π/180 for degrees→radians, 180/π for radians→degrees
❌ **Forgetting to simplify** - Always reduce fractions
❌ **Confusing π with 180** - They're equal, but π is for radians
❌ **Wrong direction** - Counterclockwise is positive, clockwise is negative
