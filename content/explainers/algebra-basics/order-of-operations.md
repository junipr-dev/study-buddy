# Order of Operations (PEMDAS)

## What is Order of Operations?

Order of operations is a set of rules that tells us which calculations to do first in a mathematical expression. Without these rules, the same problem could have different answers depending on how you solve it.

**Remember PEMDAS:**
- **P**arentheses
- **E**xponents
- **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

Also known as "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally"

Examples:
- 5 + 3 × 2 = 11 (not 16)
- (5 + 3) × 2 = 16 (parentheses first)
- 10 - 2 + 3 = 11 (left to right)

## How to Solve

Follow PEMDAS in order:

1. **Parentheses** - Solve anything inside parentheses first
2. **Exponents** - Calculate powers and square roots
3. **Multiply/Divide** - Work left to right
4. **Add/Subtract** - Work left to right
5. **Check** - Make sure you followed the order correctly

## Step-by-Step Example

**Evaluate:** 3 + 4 × 2² - (6 - 2)

### Step 1: Parentheses first
```
(6 - 2) = 4
Expression becomes: 3 + 4 × 2² - 4
```

### Step 2: Exponents
```
2² = 4
Expression becomes: 3 + 4 × 4 - 4
```

### Step 3: Multiplication (left to right)
```
4 × 4 = 16
Expression becomes: 3 + 16 - 4
```

### Step 4: Addition and subtraction (left to right)
```
3 + 16 = 19
19 - 4 = 15
```

### Step 5: Final answer
```
3 + 4 × 2² - (6 - 2) = 15
```

Verify each step follows PEMDAS order ✓

## More Examples

### Example 2: Division and multiplication
**Evaluate:** 12 ÷ 3 × 2

```
Work left to right (both are same level):
12 ÷ 3 = 4
4 × 2 = 8

Answer: 8
```

**Common mistake:** 12 ÷ (3 × 2) = 2 ← Wrong! No parentheses means left to right.

### Example 3: Nested parentheses
**Evaluate:** 5 × [3 + (8 - 2)]

```
Innermost parentheses first:
(8 - 2) = 6
Expression becomes: 5 × [3 + 6]

Next parentheses:
[3 + 6] = 9
Expression becomes: 5 × 9

Multiply:
5 × 9 = 45
```

### Example 4: Multiple operations
**Evaluate:** 20 - 3² + 4 × 2

```
Exponents:
3² = 9
Expression becomes: 20 - 9 + 4 × 2

Multiplication:
4 × 2 = 8
Expression becomes: 20 - 9 + 8

Left to right:
20 - 9 = 11
11 + 8 = 19

Answer: 19
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Parentheses always first** - Even before exponents
✓ **Multiplication = Division** - Same priority level, work left to right
✓ **Addition = Subtraction** - Same priority level, work left to right
✓ **Exponents come early** - Before multiply/divide
✓ **Left to right matters** - For operations at the same level
✓ **Work inside out** - For nested parentheses, start with innermost

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Adding before multiplying** - Wrong: 3 + 4 × 2 = 14
✓ Correct: 3 + 4 × 2 = 3 + 8 = 11

❌ **Right to left instead of left to right** - Wrong: 12 - 8 + 2 = 2
✓ Correct: 12 - 8 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6

❌ **Ignoring exponents** - Wrong: 2 × 3² = 36
✓ Correct: 2 × 3² = 2 × 9 = 18

❌ **Multiplication before parentheses** - Wrong: 2(3 + 4) = 6 + 4 = 10
✓ Correct: 2(3 + 4) = 2(7) = 14
