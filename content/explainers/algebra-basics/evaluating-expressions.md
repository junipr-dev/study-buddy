# Evaluating Algebraic Expressions

## What is Evaluating Expressions?

Evaluating an expression means finding its numerical value by substituting given numbers for the variables and calculating the result. Think of variables as empty boxes that you fill with specific numbers.

An algebraic expression contains variables (letters), numbers, and operations (like +, -, ×, ÷).

Examples:
- Evaluate 3x + 5 when x = 4
- Evaluate 2a - b when a = 7 and b = 3
- Evaluate x² + 2x - 1 when x = 5

## How to Solve

Follow these steps to evaluate any expression:

1. **Identify variables** - Note which letters need values
2. **Substitute** - Replace each variable with its given value
3. **Use parentheses** - Put substituted values in parentheses
4. **Follow PEMDAS** - Calculate using order of operations
5. **Simplify** - Work through to get a final number
6. **Check** - Verify your calculations

## Step-by-Step Example

**Evaluate:** 3x + 5 when x = 4

### Step 1: Identify the variable
Variable is **x**, and we know x = 4

### Step 2: Substitute the value
Replace x with 4:
```
3x + 5  becomes  3(4) + 5
```

### Step 3: Use order of operations
Multiply first:
```
3(4) = 12
```

### Step 4: Add
```
12 + 5 = 17
```

### Step 5: Final answer
```
When x = 4, the expression 3x + 5 equals 17
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Multiple variables
**Evaluate:** 2a - b when a = 7 and b = 3

```
Substitute:
2a - b = 2(7) - (3)

Multiply:
2(7) = 14

Subtract:
14 - 3 = 11

Answer: 11
```

**Check:** With a = 7, b = 3, we get 2(7) - 3 = 14 - 3 = 11 ✓

### Example 3: Exponents and multiple terms
**Evaluate:** x² + 2x - 1 when x = 5

```
Substitute:
(5)² + 2(5) - 1

Exponents first:
25 + 2(5) - 1

Multiply:
25 + 10 - 1

Add/subtract left to right:
35 - 1 = 34

Answer: 34
```

**Check:** 5² = 25, 2(5) = 10, 25 + 10 - 1 = 34 ✓

### Example 4: Negative values
**Evaluate:** -3y + 8 when y = -2

```
Substitute (watch the signs):
-3(-2) + 8

Multiply (negative × negative = positive):
6 + 8

Add:
14

Answer: 14
```

**Check:** -3 times -2 equals +6, plus 8 equals 14 ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Use parentheses** - Always put substituted values in parentheses
✓ **Watch negative signs** - Be careful when substituting negative numbers
✓ **Follow PEMDAS** - Order of operations still applies
✓ **Substitute everywhere** - Replace the variable every time it appears
✓ **Show your work** - Write each step clearly
✓ **One number answer** - Final result should be a single number

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Forgetting parentheses** - Wrong: 3x when x = -2 → 3-2 = 1
✓ Correct: 3(-2) = -6

❌ **Wrong order of operations** - Wrong: 2x + 3 when x = 4 → 2(4 + 3) = 14
✓ Correct: 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11

❌ **Sign errors** - Wrong: -x when x = -5 → -5
✓ Correct: -(-5) = +5

❌ **Not replacing all variables** - Wrong: 2x + x when x = 3 → 2(3) + x
✓ Correct: 2(3) + (3) = 6 + 3 = 9
