# Solving Linear Equations

## What is a Linear Equation?

A linear equation is an equation where the variable (usually x) has no exponent higher than 1. The graph of a linear equation is always a straight line.

**General form:** ax + b = c

Examples:
- 3x + 5 = 14
- 2x - 7 = 11
- x + 9 = 15

## How to Solve

Follow these steps to isolate the variable:

1. **Identify the variable** - Usually x, but can be any letter
2. **Isolate the variable term** - Move constants to the other side
3. **Use inverse operations**:
   - Addition ↔ Subtraction
   - Multiplication ↔ Division
4. **Apply to both sides** - Keep the equation balanced
5. **Simplify** - Calculate the final answer
6. **Check** - Substitute back into original equation

## Step-by-Step Example

**Solve:** 3x + 5 = 14

### Step 1: Identify the variable
Variable is **x**

### Step 2: Isolate the variable term (3x)
Subtract 5 from both sides:
```
3x + 5 - 5 = 14 - 5
3x = 9
```

### Step 3: Solve for x
Divide both sides by 3:
```
3x ÷ 3 = 9 ÷ 3
x = 3
```

### Step 4: Check your answer
Substitute x = 3 back into the original equation:
```
3(3) + 5 = 14
9 + 5 = 14
14 = 14 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Negative coefficient
**Solve:** 2x - 7 = 11

```
2x - 7 + 7 = 11 + 7    (Add 7 to both sides)
2x = 18
2x ÷ 2 = 18 ÷ 2        (Divide by 2)
x = 9
```

**Check:** 2(9) - 7 = 18 - 7 = 11 ✓

### Example 3: Fractional result
**Solve:** 5x + 3 = 10

```
5x + 3 - 3 = 10 - 3    (Subtract 3)
5x = 7
5x ÷ 5 = 7 ÷ 5         (Divide by 5)
x = 7/5 or 1.4
```

**Check:** 5(1.4) + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Same operation, both sides** - Whatever you do to one side, do to the other
✓ **Inverse operations** - Undo operations in reverse order
✓ **Work backwards** - Think about PEMDAS in reverse
✓ **Always check** - Substitute your answer back into the original equation
✓ **Negative signs** - Pay attention to signs when adding/subtracting
✓ **Simplify fully** - Make sure your answer is in simplest form

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Only changing one side** - Must balance both sides
❌ **Wrong inverse** - Remember: addition ↔ subtraction, multiplication ↔ division
❌ **Sign errors** - Be careful with negative numbers
❌ **Not checking** - Always verify your answer works
