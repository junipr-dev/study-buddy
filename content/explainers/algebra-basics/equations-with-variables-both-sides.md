# Equations with Variables on Both Sides

## What are Equations with Variables on Both Sides?

These are equations where the variable (like x) appears on both the left and right sides of the equal sign. To solve them, we need to move all variable terms to one side and all constants to the other side.

**General form:** ax + b = cx + d

Examples:
- 3x + 5 = 2x + 8
- 5x - 2 = 3x + 10
- 2x + 7 = x - 1

## How to Solve

Follow these steps to isolate the variable:

1. **Identify variable terms** - Note which terms have variables
2. **Move variables to one side** - Use addition or subtraction
3. **Move constants to other side** - Get numbers separate from variables
4. **Combine like terms** - Simplify each side
5. **Solve for the variable** - Divide or multiply if needed
6. **Check** - Substitute answer into original equation

## Step-by-Step Example

**Solve:** 3x + 5 = 2x + 8

### Step 1: Identify the parts
Left side: 3x + 5
Right side: 2x + 8

### Step 2: Move variables to one side
Subtract 2x from both sides:
```
3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 8 - 2x
x + 5 = 8
```

### Step 3: Move constants to other side
Subtract 5 from both sides:
```
x + 5 - 5 = 8 - 5
x = 3
```

### Step 4: Check your answer
Substitute x = 3 into original equation:
```
Left side: 3(3) + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
Right side: 2(3) + 8 = 6 + 8 = 14
14 = 14 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Variable with larger coefficient on right
**Solve:** 2x + 7 = 5x - 2

```
Subtract 2x from both sides:
2x + 7 - 2x = 5x - 2 - 2x
7 = 3x - 2

Add 2 to both sides:
7 + 2 = 3x - 2 + 2
9 = 3x

Divide by 3:
9 ÷ 3 = 3x ÷ 3
3 = x  or  x = 3
```

**Check:** 2(3) + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 and 5(3) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 ✓

### Example 3: Negative coefficients
**Solve:** 4x - 6 = x + 9

```
Subtract x from both sides:
4x - 6 - x = x + 9 - x
3x - 6 = 9

Add 6 to both sides:
3x - 6 + 6 = 9 + 6
3x = 15

Divide by 3:
x = 5
```

**Check:** 4(5) - 6 = 20 - 6 = 14 and (5) + 9 = 14 ✓

### Example 4: Variables cancel (special case)
**Solve:** 2x + 5 = 2x - 3

```
Subtract 2x from both sides:
2x + 5 - 2x = 2x - 3 - 2x
5 = -3

This is FALSE!
```

**Answer:** No solution (The equation is impossible)

### Example 5: All terms cancel (identity)
**Solve:** 3x + 4 = 3x + 4

```
Subtract 3x from both sides:
4 = 4

This is always TRUE!
```

**Answer:** Infinite solutions (True for all values of x)

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Same operation, both sides** - Keep equation balanced
✓ **Move variables first** - Usually easier than moving constants first
✓ **Choose the simpler side** - Move smaller variable coefficient
✓ **Combine like terms** - Simplify after each step
✓ **Special cases exist** - No solution or infinite solutions
✓ **Always check** - Substitute to verify your answer

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Only subtracting from one side** - Wrong: 3x + 5 = 2x + 8 → 3x + 5 = 8
✓ Correct: Subtract 2x from BOTH sides

❌ **Sign errors** - Wrong: 3x - 2x = 1x when it should be x
✓ Correct: Keep track of coefficients carefully

❌ **Not combining like terms** - Wrong: 3x - 2x + 5 = 3x - 2x + 8
✓ Correct: Simplify to x + 5 = 8

❌ **Forgetting to check** - Always verify your solution works!
✓ Correct: Substitute back into original equation
