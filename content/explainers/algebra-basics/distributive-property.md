# Distributive Property

## What is the Distributive Property?

The distributive property is a fundamental rule in algebra that tells us how to multiply a number by a sum or difference. It allows us to "distribute" multiplication over addition or subtraction inside parentheses.

**General form:** a(b + c) = ab + ac

Think of it like distributing cookies to groups: if you have 3 groups with (4 + 2) people each, you could either add first (3 × 6 = 18) or distribute to each part (3 × 4 + 3 × 2 = 12 + 6 = 18).

Examples:
- 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6
- 5(3 - y) = 15 - 5y
- -3(2x + 4) = -6x - 12

## How to Solve

Follow these steps to apply the distributive property:

1. **Identify** - Find the number (or variable) outside parentheses
2. **Multiply** - Multiply it by each term inside the parentheses
3. **Keep signs** - Pay attention to positive and negative signs
4. **Simplify** - Combine like terms if possible
5. **Check** - Substitute a value to verify both sides are equal

## Step-by-Step Example

**Expand:** 4(x + 5)

### Step 1: Identify the parts
- Outside number: **4**
- Inside terms: **x** and **5**

### Step 2: Distribute 4 to each term
Multiply 4 by x:
```
4 × x = 4x
```

Multiply 4 by 5:
```
4 × 5 = 20
```

### Step 3: Combine with addition
```
4(x + 5) = 4x + 20
```

### Step 4: Check your answer
Let's check with x = 2:
```
Original: 4(2 + 5) = 4(7) = 28
Expanded: 4(2) + 20 = 8 + 20 = 28 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Negative outside
**Expand:** -3(2x - 4)

```
-3 × 2x = -6x
-3 × (-4) = +12  (negative times negative = positive)

-3(2x - 4) = -6x + 12
```

**Check:** Let x = 1
```
-3(2(1) - 4) = -3(2 - 4) = -3(-2) = 6
-6(1) + 12 = -6 + 12 = 6 ✓
```

### Example 3: More terms inside
**Expand:** 2(3x + 4y - 5)

```
2 × 3x = 6x
2 × 4y = 8y
2 × (-5) = -10

2(3x + 4y - 5) = 6x + 8y - 10
```

**Check:** Let x = 1, y = 2
```
2(3(1) + 4(2) - 5) = 2(3 + 8 - 5) = 2(6) = 12
6(1) + 8(2) - 10 = 6 + 16 - 10 = 12 ✓
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Multiply everything inside** - The outside number multiplies every term in the parentheses
✓ **Watch your signs** - Negative times positive = negative, negative times negative = positive
✓ **Keep the operation** - Addition stays addition, subtraction stays subtraction (unless signs change it)
✓ **No parentheses in answer** - The final answer should have no parentheses
✓ **Can work backwards** - Reverse is called factoring (6x + 9 = 3(2x + 3))

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Only multiplying the first term** - Wrong: 3(x + 4) = 3x + 4
✓ Correct: 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12

❌ **Forgetting negative signs** - Wrong: -2(x - 3) = -2x - 6
✓ Correct: -2(x - 3) = -2x + 6

❌ **Adding instead of multiplying** - Wrong: 5(x + 2) = 5x + 2
✓ Correct: 5(x + 2) = 5x + 10
