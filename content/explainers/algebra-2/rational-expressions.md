# Simplifying Rational Expressions

## What are Rational Expressions?

A rational expression is a fraction where the numerator and/or denominator contains a polynomial. It's like a fraction, but with variables.

**General form:** P(x)/Q(x) where P and Q are polynomials

**Important:** Denominator cannot equal zero!

Examples:
- (x + 3)/(x - 2)
- (x² - 4)/(x² + 5x + 6)
- 5/(2x + 1)

## Simplifying Rational Expressions

**Goal:** Write in lowest terms by canceling common factors

**Steps:**
1. **Factor numerator** - Completely
2. **Factor denominator** - Completely
3. **Cancel common factors** - What appears in both
4. **State restrictions** - Values that make denominator zero
5. **Check** - Substitute a value to verify

## Step-by-Step Example

**Simplify:** (x² - 9)/(x² + 5x + 6)

### Step 1: Factor numerator
```
x² - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)  [difference of squares]
```

### Step 2: Factor denominator
```
x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)  [trinomial]
```

### Step 3: Write with factors
```
(x + 3)(x - 3)
--------------
(x + 2)(x + 3)
```

### Step 4: Cancel common factors
```
(x - 3)
-------  [canceled (x + 3)]
(x + 2)
```

### Step 5: State restrictions
```
x ≠ -2  (makes denominator zero)
x ≠ -3  (original denominator)
```

**Answer:** (x - 3)/(x + 2), x ≠ -2, -3

## More Examples

### Example 1: GCF canceling
**Simplify:** (6x²)/(9x)

```
Factor: 6x²/(9x) = (6 · x · x)/(9 · x)

Cancel: (2x)/3

Restriction: x ≠ 0
```

### Example 2: Complete factoring needed
**Simplify:** (x² - 4x)/(x² - 16)

```
Numerator: x² - 4x = x(x - 4)
Denominator: x² - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4)

= x(x - 4)/[(x + 4)(x - 4)]
= x/(x + 4)

Restrictions: x ≠ -4, x ≠ 4
```

### Example 3: No common factors
**Simplify:** (x + 1)/(x + 2)

```
Already in simplest form!
Cannot cancel - different binomials

Restriction: x ≠ -2
```

## Multiplying Rational Expressions

**Rule:** Multiply numerators, multiply denominators, then simplify

**Steps:**
1. Factor all polynomials
2. Cancel common factors
3. Multiply remaining factors
4. State restrictions

### Example: Multiplication

**Multiply:** (x² - 4)/(x + 3) · (x + 3)/(x + 2)

```
Factor:
(x + 2)(x - 2)   (x + 3)
------------- · -------
   (x + 3)       (x + 2)

Cancel (x + 3) and (x + 2):
= (x - 2)/1
= x - 2

Restrictions: x ≠ -3, x ≠ -2
```

## Dividing Rational Expressions

**Rule:** Multiply by reciprocal (flip second fraction)

### Example: Division

**Divide:** (x² - 1)/(x + 2) ÷ (x + 1)/(x + 3)

```
Multiply by reciprocal:
(x² - 1)/(x + 2) · (x + 3)/(x + 1)

Factor:
(x + 1)(x - 1)   (x + 3)
------------- · -------
   (x + 2)       (x + 1)

Cancel (x + 1):
= (x - 1)(x + 3)/(x + 2)

Can also expand:
= (x² + 2x - 3)/(x + 2)

Restrictions: x ≠ -2, x ≠ -1
```

## Adding/Subtracting Rational Expressions

**Rule:** Need common denominator (like fractions!)

**Steps:**
1. Factor all denominators
2. Find LCD
3. Convert to equivalent fractions
4. Add/subtract numerators
5. Simplify if possible

### Example: Addition

**Add:** 3/(x + 2) + 5/(x - 1)

```
LCD = (x + 2)(x - 1)

Convert:
3(x - 1)/[(x + 2)(x - 1)] + 5(x + 2)/[(x + 2)(x - 1)]

Add numerators:
[3(x - 1) + 5(x + 2)]/[(x + 2)(x - 1)]
= (3x - 3 + 5x + 10)/[(x + 2)(x - 1)]
= (8x + 7)/[(x + 2)(x - 1)]

Restrictions: x ≠ -2, x ≠ 1
```

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Factor completely first** - Before canceling anything
✓ **Only cancel factors** - Never cancel terms!
✓ **State restrictions** - Even if factors cancel
✓ **Multiply by reciprocal** - For division
✓ **Need LCD** - For addition/subtraction
✓ **Check answer** - Substitute a value

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Canceling terms instead of factors** - Wrong: (x + 3)/(x + 2) = 3/2
✓ Correct: Cannot cancel, different binomials

❌ **Forgetting restrictions** - Wrong: Not noting x ≠ values
✓ Correct: Always state what makes denominator zero

❌ **Partial factoring** - Wrong: (x² - 4)/(x + 2) = (x² - 4)/(x + 2)
✓ Correct: Factor first: (x + 2)(x - 2)/(x + 2) = x - 2

❌ **Adding denominators** - Wrong: a/b + c/d = (a + c)/(b + d)
✓ Correct: Need common denominator!
