# Conic Sections

## What are Conic Sections?

Conic sections are curves formed by intersecting a plane with a double cone. There are four types: circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. They appear everywhere in nature and engineering - from planetary orbits to satellite dishes.

**The four conic sections:**

1. **Circle** - All points equidistant from a center
2. **Ellipse** - Sum of distances to two foci is constant
3. **Parabola** - All points equidistant from a focus and directrix
4. **Hyperbola** - Difference of distances to two foci is constant

**Standard forms:**

**Circle:** (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r²
- Center: (h, k), Radius: r

**Ellipse:** (x - h)²/a² + (y - k)²/b² = 1
- Center: (h, k), Horizontal: a, Vertical: b

**Parabola:** y = a(x - h)² + k (vertical) or x = a(y - k)² + h (horizontal)
- Vertex: (h, k)

**Hyperbola:** (x - h)²/a² - (y - k)²/b² = 1 (horizontal)
- Center: (h, k)

## How to Identify Conic Sections

### From equations
1. **Look at x² and y² terms** - Their coefficients determine the type
2. **Check signs and coefficients:**
   - Both squared, same sign, equal coefficients → Circle
   - Both squared, same sign, different coefficients → Ellipse
   - Only one squared → Parabola
   - Both squared, opposite signs → Hyperbola

### Key features to find
1. **Center/Vertex** - (h, k) values
2. **Radius/Axes lengths** - a, b values
3. **Orientation** - Horizontal or vertical
4. **Special points** - Foci, vertices, directrix

## Step-by-Step Example

**Identify and graph:** x² + y² - 4x + 6y - 3 = 0

### Step 1: Complete the square
Group x terms and y terms:
```
(x² - 4x) + (y² + 6y) = 3
```

### Step 2: Complete each square
For x: (x² - 4x + 4) add 4
For y: (y² + 6y + 9) add 9
```
(x² - 4x + 4) + (y² + 6y + 9) = 3 + 4 + 9
(x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 16
```

### Step 3: Identify the conic
Both squared, same coefficient (1), same sign → Circle
```
(x - 2)² + (y + 3)² = 4²
```

### Step 4: Find key features
```
Center: (2, -3)
Radius: 4
```

### Step 5: Check your answer
Verify the center and radius:
```
Point (6, -3) should be on circle:
(6 - 2)² + (-3 + 3)² = 16 + 0 = 16 ✓
Distance from center = 4 ✓
```

## More Examples

### Example 2: Ellipse
**Identify:** (x - 1)²/9 + (y + 2)²/4 = 1

```
Both squared, same sign, different coefficients → Ellipse

Center: (1, -2)
a² = 9, so a = 3 (horizontal semi-axis)
b² = 4, so b = 2 (vertical semi-axis)

Vertices: (1 ± 3, -2) = (4, -2) and (-2, -2)
Co-vertices: (1, -2 ± 2) = (1, 0) and (1, -4)
```

**Check:** Plug in vertices to verify equation ✓

### Example 3: Parabola
**Identify:** y = 2(x - 3)² + 1

```
Only x is squared → Parabola (vertical)

Vertex: (3, 1)
a = 2 (opens upward, stretched)
Axis of symmetry: x = 3
```

**Check:** Vertex form matches standard parabola form ✓

### Example 4: Hyperbola
**Identify:** (x - 2)²/16 - (y + 1)²/9 = 1

```
Both squared, opposite signs → Hyperbola (horizontal)

Center: (2, -1)
a² = 16, so a = 4
b² = 9, so b = 3

Vertices: (2 ± 4, -1) = (6, -1) and (-2, -1)
Asymptotes: y + 1 = ±(3/4)(x - 2)
```

**Check:** Plug in vertices to verify equation ✓

## Key Points to Remember

✓ **Coefficients determine type** - Look at x² and y² terms first
✓ **Standard forms** - Learn to recognize each type
✓ **Complete the square** - To convert to standard form
✓ **Center vs vertex** - Circles/ellipses/hyperbolas have centers, parabolas have vertices
✓ **a and b values** - Determine size and shape
✓ **Orientation matters** - Horizontal vs vertical
✓ **Circles are special ellipses** - When a = b
✓ **Real-world applications** - Orbits, optics, architecture, engineering

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Confusing circle and ellipse** - Check if coefficients are equal
❌ **Wrong center** - Remember (x - h) means center at +h, not -h
❌ **Incomplete square** - Must add the same value to both sides
❌ **Forgetting equation = 1** - Standard forms need to equal 1 (except parabolas)
